# ADR: Routing for Large Scale React.js Project

## Context and Problem Statement

Effective routing is essential for managing navigation and user experience in a large-scale React.js project. With a complex application serving over 100,000 users, the routing solution must handle dynamic routes, nested routes, authentication, and efficient loading of components.

## Decision Drivers

1. **Dynamic Routing**: The solution should support dynamic and nested routes, enabling complex navigation structures.
2. **Performance**: It should handle routing efficiently to ensure fast and responsive navigation.
3. **Code Splitting**: The routing solution should support code splitting to improve load times and performance by loading only the necessary components.
4. **Authentication**: It should provide mechanisms for handling authenticated routes and protecting sensitive pages.
5. **Integration**: The tool should integrate seamlessly with React and other parts of the application, such as state management solutions and error boundaries.
6. **Ease of Use**: It should be straightforward to set up and use, with a clear API and good documentation.

## Considered Options

1. **React Router**
2. **Next.js Routing**
3. **Reach Router**
4. **Wouter**
5. **Remix**

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen Tool: **React Router**

#### Justification

- **Dynamic Routing**: React Router is highly flexible and supports dynamic routing, allowing for complex routing setups with nested and parameterized routes. It handles various routing patterns effectively.

- **Performance**: React Router is optimized for performance with features like lazy loading and code splitting, which helps to keep the application responsive.

- **Code Splitting**: React Router integrates well with React’s lazy loading capabilities, enabling efficient code splitting and reducing initial load times by loading only the necessary components.

- **Authentication**: Provides mechanisms for route protection and handling authenticated routes. Custom route guards and private route components can be implemented easily to manage access control.

- **Integration**: Integrates seamlessly with React and works well with state management solutions, error boundaries, and other libraries used in the application. It has a robust ecosystem and is compatible with various middlewares.

- **Ease of Use**: React Router has a well-documented API and is widely used in the React community. Its extensive documentation and community support make it easy to implement and troubleshoot.

#### Trade-offs

- **React Router vs. Next.js Routing**:
    - **Next.js Routing**: Provides built-in routing and server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities, which are excellent for projects using Next.js. However, it is tied to the Next.js framework and not suitable for projects using only React.
    - **React Router**: More flexible and can be used with a variety of React setups, including projects not using Next.js. Offers a greater level of control over routing and integration with other libraries.

- **React Router vs. Reach Router**:
    - **Reach Router**: Focuses on simplicity and accessibility, with a minimalistic API. While effective, it has been merged with React Router, and new projects are encouraged to use React Router.
    - **React Router**: Provides a more comprehensive set of features and is the recommended choice for most React applications.

- **React Router vs. Remix**:
    - **Remix**: A newer framework with a focus on server-side rendering and enhanced routing capabilities. It offers advanced features but may involve a steeper learning curve and more extensive setup.
    - **React Router**: Established and widely used with strong community support, making it a more straightforward choice for most applications.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### React Router
