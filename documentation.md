# ADR: Documentation Strategy for Large Scale React.js Project

## Context and Problem Statement

Effective documentation is crucial for maintaining a large-scale React.js project, especially as the team grows and new developers are onboarded. High-quality documentation ensures that team members can understand, maintain, and extend the codebase efficiently. This ADR outlines the strategy for documenting the project, including the tools and practices to be used.

## Decision Drivers

1. **Clarity**: Clear and concise documentation for developers and stakeholders.
2. **Consistency**: Uniform documentation practices across the entire project.
3. **Ease of Use**: Simple tools and workflows for writing and maintaining documentation.
4. **Integration**: Seamless integration with the development workflow and CI/CD pipelines.
5. **Community Support**: Widely used and well-supported tools with good documentation.

## Considered Options

1. **Storybook**
2. **Docusaurus**
3. **JSDoc**
4. **Markdown with GitHub Pages**
5. **Confluence**
6. **Kitchen Sink**

### Option 1: Storybook

**Description**: Storybook is an open-source tool for developing UI components in isolation for React, Vue, and Angular. It makes building and documenting UI components easier.

#### Pros
- **Component Isolation**: Allows for developing and testing components in isolation.
- **Interactive Documentation**: Provides a live, interactive environment for exploring and documenting components.
- **Add-ons**: Rich ecosystem of add-ons for additional functionality.

#### Cons
- **Learning Curve**: Requires learning how to set up and use Storybook.
- **Setup Overhead**: Initial setup and configuration can be time-consuming.

### Option 2: Docusaurus

**Description**: Docusaurus is an open-source static site generator that makes it easy to maintain open-source documentation websites.

#### Pros
- **Ease of Use**: Simple setup and intuitive for creating documentation websites.
- **Customization**: Highly customizable with themes and plugins.
- **Markdown Support**: Uses Markdown for writing documentation, which is easy to learn and use.

#### Cons
- **Static Site**: Limited to static content, not suitable for interactive documentation like Storybook.
- **Additional Hosting**: Requires hosting for the generated static site.

### Option 3: JSDoc

**Description**: JSDoc is a tool for generating documentation from JavaScript source code comments.

#### Pros
- **Inline Documentation**: Allows documenting code inline, making it easy to keep documentation up to date.
- **Standardized**: Widely used and supported in the JavaScript community.
- **Automated**: Automatically generates HTML documentation from comments.

#### Cons
- **Limited Scope**: Focused on code documentation, not suitable for broader project documentation.
- **Learning Curve**: Requires understanding of JSDoc syntax and conventions.

### Option 4: Markdown with GitHub Pages

**Description**: Using Markdown files for documentation and hosting them on GitHub Pages.

#### Pros
- **Simplicity**: Easy to write and maintain using Markdown.
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with GitHub repositories.
- **Free Hosting**: GitHub Pages provides free hosting for documentation.

#### Cons
- **Static Content**: Limited to static content, no interactive documentation.
- **Customization**: Limited customization options compared to tools like Docusaurus.

### Option 5: Confluence

**Description**: Confluence is a team collaboration tool for creating, sharing, and collaborating on projects and documentation.

#### Pros
- **Collaboration**: Excellent for team collaboration and knowledge sharing.
- **Integration**: Integrates well with other Atlassian tools like Jira.
- **Rich Features**: Offers a wide range of features for documentation and project management.

#### Cons
- **Cost**: Requires a subscription, which can be expensive for large teams.
- **Learning Curve**: Requires learning how to use Confluence effectively.

### Option 6: Kitchen Sink

**Description**: A custom-built documentation solution that includes various types of documentation like API docs, user guides, and tutorials.

#### Pros
- **Tailored Solution**: Fully customizable to meet specific project needs.
- **Comprehensive**: Can include various types of documentation in one place.

#### Cons
- **Maintenance**: Requires significant effort to build and maintain.
- **Development Overhead**: Time-consuming to set up and manage.

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen Approach: **Combination of Storybook, Docusaurus, and JSDoc**

For our large-scale React.js project, we recommend using a combination of **Storybook**, **Docusaurus**, and **JSDoc**:

- **Storybook**: For interactive documentation and isolated development of UI components.
- **Docusaurus**: For creating a static site for general project documentation, user guides, and tutorials.
- **JSDoc**: For inline code documentation, ensuring that the codebase is well-documented and easy to understand.

This combination provides a comprehensive documentation strategy that covers various aspects of the project, from UI components to general project information and inline code documentation.
