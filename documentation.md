# ADR: Documentation for Large Scale React.js Project

## Context and Problem Statement

Effective documentation is essential for maintaining a large-scale React.js project. Good documentation facilitates collaboration, onboarding, and ongoing development by providing clear information on how the project works, how to contribute, and how to use various components and tools.

## Decision Drivers

1. **Comprehensiveness**: Documentation should cover all aspects of the project, including architecture, components, APIs, and development processes.
2. **Accessibility**: It should be easy to access and navigate, allowing developers and stakeholders to find information quickly.
3. **Consistency**: The documentation should follow a consistent format and style to ensure clarity and coherence.
4. **Maintainability**: Documentation should be easy to update and maintain as the project evolves.
5. **Integration**: It should integrate well with development tools and workflows.
6. **User-Friendliness**: The documentation should be clear and understandable for both new and experienced developers.

## Considered Options

1. **Markdown Files in Repository**
2. **Dedicated Documentation Platforms (e.g., Docusaurus, GitBook)**
3. **Inline Code Documentation (e.g., JSDoc)**
4. **Wikis (e.g., GitHub Wiki)**
5. **API Documentation Tools (e.g., Swagger, Postman)**
6. **Storybook**
7. **Kitchen Sink**

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen Approach: **Markdown Files in Repository with Dedicated Documentation Platform and Storybook**

#### Justification

- **Comprehensiveness**: Markdown files in the repository provide detailed documentation on the architecture, components, and development processes. A dedicated documentation platform like Docusaurus offers a structured solution for comprehensive documentation, including user guides and developer instructions. Storybook provides interactive component documentation and showcases.

- **Accessibility**: Markdown files are easily accessible within the repository, and dedicated platforms offer searchable and navigable documentation sites. Storybook allows developers to interact with components and view their various states, improving accessibility and understanding.

- **Consistency**: A dedicated documentation platform ensures consistent formatting and styling. Storybook provides a consistent view of component states and usage, which helps maintain uniformity in UI components and their documentation.

- **Maintainability**: Markdown files and dedicated platforms can be updated easily as the project evolves. Storybook documentation updates as components change, ensuring that UI documentation stays current with the latest design and functionality.

- **Integration**: Markdown files are integrated with version control systems, and dedicated platforms fit well within development workflows. Storybook integrates with development environments and build processes, providing a seamless way to document and test UI components.

- **User-Friendliness**: Markdown files are familiar to developers, and dedicated platforms offer enhanced features like search and interactive examples. Storybook provides a hands-on approach to understanding component behavior and design, enhancing the user experience for both developers and designers.

#### Trade-offs

- **Markdown Files vs. Dedicated Documentation Platforms**:
    - **Markdown Files**: Simple and effective for smaller projects or specific documentation needs. However, they may lack advanced features and structured navigation provided by dedicated platforms.
    - **Dedicated Documentation Platforms**: Offer enhanced features, such as search, versioning, and structured navigation, which are beneficial for larger projects with complex documentation requirements.

- **Markdown Files vs. Inline Code Documentation**:
    - **Inline Code Documentation (e.g., JSDoc)**: Provides documentation directly within the code, which is useful for API reference and developer guidance. However, it may not cover broader project aspects such as architecture and usage.
    - **Markdown Files**: Provide a more comprehensive and structured approach to documentation, including high-level overviews and developer guides.

- **Dedicated Documentation Platforms vs. Wikis**:
    - **Wikis (e.g., GitHub Wiki)**: Useful for collaborative documentation and internal knowledge sharing but may lack advanced features and structured layout compared to dedicated platforms.
    - **Dedicated Documentation Platforms**: Offer more features for creating and managing extensive documentation, including search functionality and better organization.

- **Dedicated Documentation Platforms vs. API Documentation Tools**:
    - **API Documentation Tools (e.g., Swagger, Postman)**: Focus on API documentation and testing, providing detailed information about API endpoints and usage. They are essential for API development but may not cover other aspects of the project.
    - **Dedicated Documentation Platforms**: Provide a broader solution for all project documentation needs, including architecture, components, and usage guides.

- **Storybook vs. Kitchen Sink**:
    - **Storybook**: Provides an interactive environment for developing and documenting UI components, showcasing different states and variations. It is well-suited for visual documentation and testing of components. However, it focuses primarily on component-level documentation rather than overall project documentation.
    - **Kitchen Sink**: Refers to a collection of example components and use cases typically bundled together. It can be useful for demonstrating various components but may lack the interactive and comprehensive features of Storybook.
