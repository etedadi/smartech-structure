# ADR: Monitoring / Log Manager for Large Scale React.js Project

## Context and Problem Statement

Effective monitoring and logging are essential for maintaining the reliability and performance of a large-scale React.js project. With a complex application serving over 100,000 users, monitoring performance metrics, tracking errors, and managing logs are crucial for diagnosing issues, ensuring uptime, and improving user experience.

## Decision Drivers

1. **Real-Time Monitoring**: The solution should provide real-time insights into application performance and user interactions.
2. **Error Tracking**: It should efficiently capture and track errors, including front-end errors and back-end issues.
3. **Log Management**: The tool should manage and analyze logs from various sources, including client-side and server-side logs.
4. **Scalability**: The solution should scale with the application's growth and handle increasing volumes of data and traffic.
5. **Integration**: It should integrate well with existing tools and workflows, including deployment pipelines and alerting systems.
6. **Ease of Use**: The tool should be user-friendly and provide actionable insights with minimal configuration.

## Considered Options

1. **Sentry**
2. **LogRocket**
3. **Datadog**
4. **New Relic**
5. **Elastic Stack (ELK Stack)**

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen Tools: **Sentry and Datadog**

#### Justification

- **Sentry**:
    - **Real-Time Monitoring**: Sentry provides real-time error tracking and monitoring for both front-end and back-end applications. It captures detailed error reports and stack traces, allowing for quick diagnosis and resolution of issues.
    - **Error Tracking**: Specializes in tracking and aggregating errors, providing context such as user actions, device information, and environment details. It supports various integrations and platforms, including JavaScript, React, and Next.js.
    - **Log Management**: While Sentry focuses more on error tracking, it also offers basic log management features through integrations with other logging tools.
    - **Scalability**: Sentry scales well with application size and complexity, handling high volumes of error reports and user interactions.
    - **Integration**: Easily integrates with popular development and deployment tools, including GitHub, Slack, and various CI/CD pipelines.
    - **Ease of Use**: Provides a user-friendly interface with actionable insights and alerting capabilities.

- **Datadog**:
    - **Real-Time Monitoring**: Datadog offers comprehensive monitoring solutions, including application performance monitoring (APM), infrastructure monitoring, and real-time dashboards. It provides a unified view of performance metrics and logs.
    - **Error Tracking**: Supports error tracking across both front-end and back-end services, with detailed performance insights and distributed tracing.
    - **Log Management**: Provides robust log management capabilities, including log aggregation, search, and analysis. It supports various log sources and integrates with other monitoring tools.
    - **Scalability**: Datadog is designed to handle large-scale environments and can manage extensive data volumes and traffic.
    - **Integration**: Integrates well with a wide range of tools and services, including cloud providers, container orchestration platforms, and development tools.
    - **Ease of Use**: Offers a comprehensive and intuitive interface for monitoring, analyzing, and alerting on various metrics and logs.

#### Trade-offs

- **Sentry vs. LogRocket**:
    - **LogRocket**: Provides session replay and detailed user interaction tracking, which is useful for debugging user issues. However, it focuses more on session replay and front-end tracking rather than comprehensive error tracking and monitoring.
    - **Sentry**: Offers extensive error tracking and integration capabilities, making it a better fit for overall error management and monitoring.

- **Datadog vs. New Relic**:
    - **New Relic**: Offers robust APM and monitoring features with strong performance metrics. However, Datadog provides more comprehensive log management and a broader set of monitoring capabilities.
    - **Datadog**: Provides a unified monitoring solution with both APM and log management, making it suitable for diverse monitoring needs.

- **Datadog vs. Elastic Stack (ELK Stack)**:
    - **Elastic Stack (ELK Stack)**: Offers powerful log aggregation and search capabilities, with extensive customization options. It requires more setup and maintenance compared to Datadog.
    - **Datadog**: Provides a more integrated and user-friendly solution with less setup and maintenance effort, while still offering robust log management and monitoring features.
