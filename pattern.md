# ADR: Design Patterns for Large Scale React.js Project

## Context and Problem Statement

Effective design patterns are critical for managing complexity, ensuring code maintainability, and facilitating scalability in a large-scale React.js project. Proper patterns help in code organization, improving developer productivity, and enhancing code reusability.

## Decision Drivers

1. **Maintainability**: Patterns should facilitate easy updates and understanding of the codebase.
2. **Scalability**: Patterns should support the application's growth and complexity.
3. **Reusability**: Encourage reuse of code and components across the application.
4. **Performance**: Patterns should not adversely affect performance.
5. **Best Practices**: Align with industry best practices and standards.

## Considered Options

1. **Container-Presenter Pattern**
2. **Higher-Order Components (HOCs)**
3. **Custom Hooks**
4. **Render Props**
5. **Compound Components**

### Option 1: Container-Presenter Pattern

**Description**: Separates business logic (container) from UI rendering (presenter). Containers manage state and side effects, while presenters focus on displaying data.

#### Pros
- **Separation of Concerns**: Enhances code readability and separation of logic from presentation.
- **Testability**: Simplifies testing of presentational components.

#### Cons
- **Boilerplate**: Increases the number of components and files.
- **Complexity**: Adds complexity, particularly for simpler components.

### Option 2: Higher-Order Components (HOCs)

**Description**: A pattern where functions take a component and return a new component with additional functionality.

#### Pros
- **Reusability**: Allows logic to be reused across multiple components.
- **Encapsulation**: Encapsulates shared logic without modifying component structure.

#### Cons
- **Wrapper Hell**: Can create deeply nested components, making debugging difficult.
- **Debugging**: More complex to debug due to additional abstraction layers.

### Option 3: Custom Hooks

**Description**: Functions that encapsulate reusable stateful logic, which can be shared across components.

#### Pros
- **Modularity**: Encapsulates complex logic in a reusable way.
- **Simplicity**: Makes components cleaner and easier to understand.

#### Cons
- **Abstraction**: Requires understanding of React hooks and functional programming.
- **Debugging**: Can be challenging to debug complex hook logic.

### Option 4: Render Props

**Description**: A pattern where a component uses a function as a prop to determine what to render, enabling logic sharing.

#### Pros
- **Flexibility**: Offers a flexible way to share logic between components.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Facilitates dynamic content rendering based on function output.

#### Cons
- **Verbosity**: Can lead to more verbose and less readable JSX.
- **Performance**: May introduce performance overhead from frequent function creation.

### Option 5: Compound Components

**Description**: Components that work together to manage shared state and behavior, typically with a common parent component.

#### Pros
- **Encapsulation**: Manages state and behavior within a parent component, reducing complexity.
- **Flexibility**: Allows various configurations and compositions of child components.

#### Cons
- **Complexity**: Managing shared state and behavior can introduce additional complexity.

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen Approach: **Combination of Custom Hooks, Container-Presenter Pattern, and Compound Components**

For our large-scale React.js project, we recommend the following mixed approach:

- **Custom Hooks**: Use Custom Hooks to encapsulate reusable stateful logic and side effects. This approach improves modularity and code reusability.
- **Container-Presenter Pattern**: Implement this pattern to separate business logic from UI rendering, enhancing code organization and testability.
- **Compound Components**: Employ this pattern to manage shared state and behavior within a parent component, providing flexibility in component composition.

By integrating these patterns, we balance modularity, maintainability, and scalability, ensuring that our codebase remains organized and adaptable to changes.
