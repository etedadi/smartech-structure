# ADR: Base Patterns for Large Scale React.js Project

## Context and Problem Statement

As we continue to scale our enterprise-level projects, it is essential to adopt base patterns that ensure maintainability, scalability, and efficiency. Our application serves over 100,000 users in a B2B context and involves advanced user panels like Google Ads and Adjust.com. We need to decide on the best patterns to follow in our React.js codebase to support these requirements.

## Decision Drivers

1. **Maintainability**: Code should be easy to read, understand, and modify.
2. **Scalability**: The codebase should be able to grow without significant refactoring.
3. **Reusability**: Components and logic should be reusable across different parts of the application.
4. **Performance**: Patterns should promote efficient rendering and minimize performance bottlenecks.
5. **Developer Experience**: Patterns should be intuitive and enhance developer productivity.

## Considered Options

1. **Component Composition**
2. **Container-Presenter Pattern**
3. **Higher-Order Components (HOCs)**
4. **Render Props**
5. **Hooks**
6. **Atomic Design**
7. **Context API**

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen Patterns: **Component Composition, Hooks, and Atomic Design**

#### Justification

- **Component Composition**:
  - **Maintainability**: Encourages breaking down complex UIs into smaller, more manageable pieces. This results in a more readable and maintainable codebase since each component handles a specific part of the UI.
  - **Scalability**: By composing components together, itâ€™s easier to scale and extend the application without having to rewrite or significantly alter existing code.
  - **Reusability**: Promotes the creation of reusable components, which can be combined in different ways to build complex interfaces, reducing code duplication and improving consistency across the application.
  - **Developer Experience**: Simplifies the process of building and managing UI elements, making it easier for developers to understand and work with the code.

- **Hooks**:
  - **Maintainability**: Hooks allow for the management of state and side effects within functional components, which can be easier to maintain and understand compared to class components with lifecycle methods.
  - **Scalability**: Hooks enable the reuse of stateful logic across different components without needing higher-order components or render props, making it easier to scale the application.
  - **Performance**: Hooks are optimized for performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders and allowing fine-grained control over component updates.
  - **Developer Experience**: Provides a cleaner and more concise API for managing component logic, reducing boilerplate code and improving readability.

- **Atomic Design**:
  - **Maintainability**: Provides a clear structure for organizing components into Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates, and Pages. This hierarchical approach helps in maintaining a consistent design language and makes it easier to update or replace components.
  - **Scalability**: By breaking down the UI into smaller, reusable building blocks, Atomic Design supports scalability. New features or changes can be implemented by updating or adding new components at the appropriate level of the hierarchy.
  - **Reusability**: Encourages the creation of modular components that can be reused across different parts of the application, which helps in maintaining consistency and reducing redundancy.
  - **Developer Experience**: Offers a systematic approach to building UIs, making it easier for developers to understand how different components fit together and interact.

#### Trade-offs

- **Component Composition vs. HOCs**: Higher-Order Components (HOCs) can create deeply nested structures that are harder to manage and debug. Component composition provides a more intuitive and flexible approach to combining components, avoiding the complexity of HOCs.

- **Hooks vs. Render Props**: While Render Props offer a way to share logic between components, they can result in verbose and less readable code. Hooks simplify this process by allowing developers to extract and reuse logic in a more concise manner.

- **Atomic Design**: Implementing Atomic Design requires an initial setup and discipline to follow the design system. However, this upfront investment leads to a more organized and maintainable codebase in the long run, providing significant benefits in consistency and scalability.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Component Composition

- **Pros**:
  - Promotes reusability and maintainability
  - Simplifies the UI development process
  - Encourages clean separation of concerns

- **Cons**:
  - Potentially leads to a large number of small components, which may require careful management

### Hooks

- **Pros**:
  - Simplifies state and side-effect management in functional components
  - Reduces boilerplate code and improves readability
  - Enhances performance through optimized rendering

- **Cons**:
  - Requires understanding of JavaScript closures and functional programming concepts, which might have a learning curve

### Atomic Design

- **Pros**:
  - Provides a systematic approach to building UIs
  - Improves consistency and reusability
  - Facilitates scalability and easier maintenance

- **Cons**:
  - Initial setup and adherence to the design system can be time-consuming
  - Requires discipline and commitment to the design methodology

### Container-Presenter Pattern

- **Pros**:
  - Separates UI logic from business logic, enhancing code organization
  - Makes it easier to manage and update UI and logic separately

- **Cons**:
  - May result in a larger number of components, which can be cumbersome
  - Potential for over-engineering simple use cases

### Higher-Order Components (HOCs)

- **Pros**:
  - Effective for reusing component logic
  - Promotes separation of concerns

- **Cons**:
  - Can lead to nested and less readable code
  - More complex to debug and test

### Render Props

- **Pros**:
  - Provides flexibility in sharing logic between components
  - Encourages code reuse

- **Cons**:
  - Can result in verbose and less readable code
  - May introduce complexity in managing props

### Context API

- **Pros**:
  - Simplifies global state management and avoids prop drilling
  - Useful for sharing data across many components

- **Cons**:
  - Can lead to tightly coupled components
  - Not ideal for frequent state updates due to potential performance issues
