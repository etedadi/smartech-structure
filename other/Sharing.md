# ADR: Sharing Source Code Between Teams and Integrating Products for Large Scale React.js Project

## Context and Problem Statement

As a project scales, multiple teams may work on different parts of the codebase or on related products. Efficiently sharing source code and integrating products between teams is essential for maintaining consistency, reducing duplication, and ensuring smooth collaboration.

## Decision Drivers

1. **Code Reusability**: The approach should promote code reuse and avoid duplication across teams.
2. **Integration Complexity**: The method for integrating code and products should be manageable and minimize complexity.
3. **Consistency**: Shared code should be consistent in terms of quality and style.
4. **Version Control**: The solution should support versioning and track changes effectively.
5. **Collaboration**: The approach should facilitate collaboration and communication between teams.

## Considered Options

1. **Monorepos**
2. **Shared Libraries**
3. **Microservices Architecture**
4. **Package Management Systems**
5. **CI/CD Integration**

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen Approach: **Monorepos, Shared Libraries, Microservices Architecture, and CI/CD Integration**

#### Justification

- **Monorepos**:
    - **Description**: Use a single repository to manage all related projects and codebases. This approach allows teams to share code easily and integrate products within the same repository.
    - **Pros**: Simplifies dependency management and versioning. Allows for easy cross-team collaboration and code sharing. Facilitates atomic commits and integrated testing.
    - **Cons**: Can lead to large repositories that may become difficult to manage. Requires robust tooling and processes to handle the complexity.

- **Shared Libraries**:
    - **Description**: Create and maintain shared libraries or packages that can be used across different projects or teams. These libraries encapsulate common functionality and components.
    - **Pros**: Promotes code reuse and consistency. Easier to maintain and update shared functionality. Reduces duplication of code.
    - **Cons**: Requires version management and dependency handling. May lead to tight coupling between projects if not managed properly.

- **Microservices Architecture**:
    - **Description**: Adopt a microservices architecture where different functionalities are developed as independent services that communicate over APIs. Each team can work on a separate service with well-defined interfaces.
    - **Pros**: Allows teams to work independently on different services. Promotes modularity and scalability. Facilitates integration of different products.
    - **Cons**: Introduces complexity in service communication and deployment. Requires robust API management and integration testing.

- **CI/CD Integration**:
    - **Description**: Implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. Integrate these pipelines with code sharing and product integration workflows.
    - **Pros**: Ensures that code changes are tested and deployed consistently. Facilitates smooth integration and delivery of new features. Improves collaboration and reduces manual intervention.
    - **Cons**: Requires initial setup and ongoing maintenance. May need adjustments as the project evolves.

#### Trade-offs

- **Monorepos**:
    - **Pros**: Simplifies code sharing and integration; unified version control and build processes.
    - **Cons**: Large repository management challenges; potential for increased build times and complexity.

- **Shared Libraries**:
    - **Pros**: Encourages code reuse; easier to update and maintain shared functionality.
    - **Cons**: Requires careful version management; potential for tight coupling between projects.

- **Microservices Architecture**:
    - **Pros**: Modular and scalable; teams work independently; clear service boundaries.
    - **Cons**: Complex service communication; requires effective API management and testing.

- **CI/CD Integration**:
    - **Pros**: Automated build and deployment; consistent testing and integration.
    - **Cons**: Requires setup and maintenance; may need adjustments for evolving project needs.
