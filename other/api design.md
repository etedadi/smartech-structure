# ADR: API Design for Large Scale React.js Project

## Context and Problem Statement

API design is crucial for ensuring that the interaction between the frontend and backend is efficient, reliable, and maintainable. For a large-scale React.js project, a well-designed API can improve performance, scalability, and developer productivity.

## Decision Drivers

1. **Consistency**: The API design should be consistent in naming conventions, data formats, and error handling.
2. **Scalability**: The API should be designed to handle increasing load and data volumes without performance degradation.
3. **Security**: The API should include security measures to protect data and prevent unauthorized access.
4. **Documentation**: The API should be well-documented to facilitate ease of use and integration by frontend developers.
5. **Versioning**: The API should include versioning to manage changes and maintain backward compatibility.

## Considered Options

1. **RESTful API Design**
2. **GraphQL**
3. **API Versioning**
4. **Security Best Practices**
5. **Documentation Tools**

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen Approach: **RESTful API Design, GraphQL, API Versioning, Security Best Practices, and Documentation Tools**

#### Justification

- **RESTful API Design**:
    - **Stateless Operations**: RESTful APIs operate over stateless HTTP methods, which simplifies server-side management and improves scalability. Each request from a client contains all the information the server needs to fulfill it.
    - **Resource-Based**: REST APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources. This approach is intuitive and aligns with CRUD operations.
    - **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Use consistent and meaningful resource names and endpoint structures to ensure clarity and ease of use.

- **GraphQL**:
    - **Flexible Queries**: GraphQL allows clients to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching issues common in REST APIs.
    - **Single Endpoint**: Unlike REST, which may require multiple endpoints, GraphQL uses a single endpoint for all queries and mutations. This simplifies API management and integration.
    - **Strongly Typed Schema**: GraphQLâ€™s schema defines the structure of the API and supports type checking, which helps in building robust APIs and catching errors early.

- **API Versioning**:
    - **URL Versioning**: Include version numbers in the URL path (e.g., `/api/v1/resource`) to manage changes and maintain backward compatibility. This approach is simple and commonly used.
    - **Header Versioning**: Use custom headers to specify API versions (e.g., `Accept: application/vnd.example.v1+json`). This keeps URLs clean but may require additional handling in client code.

- **Security Best Practices**:
    - **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement authentication (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT) to ensure that only authorized users can access the API. Authorization checks should be enforced to control access to different resources and actions.
    - **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to protect the API from abuse and ensure fair usage. This helps prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and maintains performance.
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Validate and sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity. This is crucial for maintaining security and robustness.

- **Documentation Tools**:
    - **Swagger/OpenAPI**: Use Swagger (OpenAPI) for designing and documenting RESTful APIs. It provides an interactive API documentation interface and integrates with many tools for testing and client code generation.
    - **GraphQL Playground**: For GraphQL APIs, use GraphQL Playground to provide an interactive documentation and testing environment. It allows developers to explore and test GraphQL queries and mutations easily.

#### Trade-offs

- **RESTful API Design**:
    - **Pros**: Simple and intuitive; aligns with standard HTTP methods; widely supported and easy to understand.
    - **Cons**: Can lead to over-fetching or under-fetching data; may require multiple endpoints for complex queries.

- **GraphQL**:
    - **Pros**: Flexible queries; single endpoint; strong typing and introspection.
    - **Cons**: More complex to implement and manage; may require additional tooling and server configuration.

- **API Versioning**:
    - **Pros**: Allows for non-breaking changes and maintains backward compatibility; clear versioning strategy.
    - **Cons**: URL versioning can lead to cluttered endpoints; header versioning requires additional handling in client code.

- **Security Best Practices**:
    - **Pros**: Protects against unauthorized access and abuse; ensures data integrity and confidentiality.
    - **Cons**: Adds complexity to implementation and may require ongoing monitoring and adjustments.

- **Documentation Tools**:
    - **Pros**: Provides interactive documentation and testing tools; simplifies integration and usage.
    - **Cons**: Requires setup and maintenance; may add overhead to the development process.
