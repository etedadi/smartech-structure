# ADR: Security for Large Scale React.js Project

## Context and Problem Statement

Security is a critical aspect of any application, especially for large-scale projects handling sensitive user data. Ensuring robust security measures helps protect against vulnerabilities and threats, ensuring the safety of both user data and application integrity.

## Decision Drivers

1. **Data Protection**: Safeguard sensitive user data and ensure data privacy.
2. **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement secure mechanisms for user authentication and authorization.
3. **Vulnerability Prevention**: Prevent common vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
4. **Secure Communication**: Ensure secure transmission of data between the client and server.
5. **Maintainability**: Implement security practices that are manageable and do not overly complicate development.

## Considered Options

1. **Secure Authentication and Authorization**
2. **Input Validation and Sanitization**
3. **Secure Communication**
4. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
5. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection**
6. **Error Handling and Logging**

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen Approach: **Secure Authentication and Authorization, Input Validation and Sanitization, Secure Communication, Content Security Policy (CSP), CSRF Protection, and Error Handling and Logging**

#### Justification

- **Secure Authentication and Authorization**:
    - **Use OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect**: Implementing secure protocols for authentication and authorization. Libraries such as `Passport.js` or `Auth0` provide robust solutions for managing authentication flows and user permissions.
    - **Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For stateless authentication. JWTs are useful for maintaining secure sessions and are widely supported.

- **Input Validation and Sanitization**:
    - **Client-side Validation**: Ensures that user inputs meet expected formats before sending data to the server. Libraries such as `yup` or `validator.js` can help with validation.
    - **Server-side Validation**: Always validate and sanitize inputs on the server-side to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.

- **Secure Communication**:
    - **Use HTTPS**: Encrypts data transmitted between the client and server. Ensure that all connections use HTTPS to protect data from eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
    - **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)**: Enforces HTTPS by preventing the use of HTTP connections. Configure HSTS headers to ensure that browsers only connect to your site using HTTPS.

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**:
    - **Implement CSP**: Define a CSP to control which resources can be loaded by the browser, reducing the risk of XSS attacks. Use directives like `default-src`, `script-src`, and `style-src` to control resource loading.

- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection**:
    - **Use CSRF Tokens**: Implement anti-CSRF tokens to protect against CSRF attacks. Libraries like `csrf` can help manage token generation and validation.
    - **SameSite Cookies**: Set the `SameSite` attribute on cookies to prevent them from being sent with cross-site requests.

- **Error Handling and Logging**:
    - **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Ensure that error messages do not expose sensitive information. Use generic error messages and log detailed errors on the server-side.
    - **Use Logging Libraries**: Implement logging to track security-related events and potential issues. Tools like `winston` or `log4js` can be used for structured logging.

#### Trade-offs

- **Secure Authentication and Authorization**:
    - **Pros**: Provides robust security for user access and sessions. Protocols like OAuth 2.0 and JWT are widely accepted and secure.
    - **Cons**: Can introduce complexity in managing authentication flows and token handling.

- **Input Validation and Sanitization**:
    - **Pros**: Prevents injection attacks and ensures data integrity. Both client-side and server-side validation are essential.
    - **Cons**: Requires additional development effort to implement and maintain validation logic.

- **Secure Communication**:
    - **Pros**: Encrypts data and protects against eavesdropping and tampering. HTTPS is essential for secure data transmission.
    - **Cons**: Requires proper configuration and management of SSL/TLS certificates.

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**:
    - **Pros**: Reduces the risk of XSS attacks by controlling resource loading. Provides a robust security layer.
    - **Cons**: Requires careful configuration and testing to avoid breaking legitimate functionality.

- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection**:
    - **Pros**: Protects against CSRF attacks by using tokens and SameSite cookies. Enhances application security.
    - **Cons**: Requires implementation of anti-CSRF mechanisms and token management.

- **Error Handling and Logging**:
    - **Pros**: Helps track and manage security issues and application errors. Improves visibility into potential threats.
    - **Cons**: Requires proper configuration to avoid exposing sensitive information and to manage log data.
