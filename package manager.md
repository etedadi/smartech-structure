# ADR: Package Manager for Large Scale React.js Project

## Context and Problem Statement

Choosing an appropriate package manager is essential for managing dependencies, ensuring consistent builds, and facilitating efficient development workflows in a large-scale React.js project.

## Decision Drivers

1. **Performance**: The package manager should handle dependency management efficiently.
2. **Stability**: Ensures reliable and consistent builds across different environments.
3. **Community Support**: A strong community and frequent updates to address bugs and vulnerabilities.
4. **Compatibility**: Works well with the existing tooling and ecosystem.
5. **Ease of Use**: Should be user-friendly and integrate smoothly with CI/CD pipelines.

## Considered Options

1. **npm (Node Package Manager)**
2. **Yarn**
3. **pnpm**

### Option 1: npm (Node Package Manager)

**Description**: The default package manager for Node.js. It handles package installation, dependency management, and script execution.

#### Pros
- **Widespread Adoption**: Most Node.js projects and tools are compatible with npm.
- **Built-in CLI**: Comes pre-installed with Node.js, reducing setup overhead.
- **Improved Performance**: Recent versions have improved speed and performance.

#### Cons
- **Performance Issues**: Historically, npm has faced performance issues with large dependency trees.
- **Lockfile Stability**: Earlier versions had issues with consistency and reliability of lockfiles.

### Option 2: Yarn

**Description**: A package manager developed by Facebook as an alternative to npm, focusing on performance improvements and deterministic dependency resolution.

#### Pros
- **Performance**: Faster dependency installation due to parallelization and caching.
- **Deterministic Dependency Resolution**: Ensures consistent installations with lockfiles.
- **Workspaces**: Supports monorepo management with built-in workspaces.

#### Cons
- **Additional Setup**: Requires installation separately from Node.js.
- **Compatibility**: While compatible with most npm packages, there may be occasional issues with some packages.

### Option 3: pnpm

**Description**: A fast and efficient package manager that uses a unique method for storing dependencies in a global store and linking them into projects.

#### Pros
- **Performance**: Significantly faster and more efficient due to its unique storage method.
- **Disk Space Savings**: Shares dependencies between projects, reducing disk space usage.
- **Compatibility**: Fully compatible with npm and Yarn.

#### Cons
- **Adoption**: Less widely adopted compared to npm and Yarn, which might impact community support.
- **Tooling Integration**: Some tools and integrations might not be fully compatible yet.

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen Approach: **Yarn**

For our large-scale React.js project, we recommend using **Yarn** as the package manager:

- **Performance**: Yarnâ€™s parallelized installation process and caching improve dependency management efficiency.
- **Deterministic Dependency Resolution**: Ensures consistent builds with reliable lockfiles.
- **Workspaces**: Facilitates management of monorepos, which can be beneficial as the project grows.

Yarn balances performance, stability, and ease of use, making it well-suited for managing complex dependencies in a large-scale project.
