# ADR: Package Manager for Large Scale React.js Project

## Context and Problem Statement

Choosing the right package manager is critical for managing dependencies, handling updates, and ensuring the stability of a large-scale React.js project. With a complex application serving over 100,000 users, the package manager must efficiently handle dependency management, support for large codebases, and integration with the development workflow.

## Decision Drivers

1. **Performance**: The package manager should handle installation and resolution of dependencies efficiently.
2. **Dependency Management**: It should provide robust tools for managing, updating, and resolving package dependencies.
3. **Compatibility**: The package manager should integrate well with existing tools, libraries, and the development environment.
4. **User Experience**: The package manager should offer a smooth and intuitive user experience for managing packages and configurations.
5. **Community and Ecosystem**: It should have strong community support and ecosystem, ensuring ongoing maintenance and support.

## Considered Options

1. **npm**
2. **Yarn**
3. **pnpm**

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen Package Manager: **pnpm**

#### Justification

- **pnpm**:
    - **Performance**: pnpm is known for its high performance in dependency management. It uses a unique approach to handling dependencies by creating a single store of packages that are linked to projects, which reduces duplication and speeds up installation times.
    - **Dependency Management**: pnpm employs a deterministic algorithm for dependency resolution, ensuring consistent and predictable dependency trees across different environments. Its strict versioning and package hoisting practices help in avoiding issues related to dependency conflicts.
    - **Compatibility**: pnpm integrates well with existing tools and libraries in the React ecosystem. It supports popular package registries and works seamlessly with various build systems and development workflows.
    - **User Experience**: pnpm provides a straightforward command-line interface and useful features like workspace support for managing monorepos. It also offers features like `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` to ensure consistent installs.
    - **Community and Ecosystem**: pnpm has gained significant traction and support within the JavaScript community. It is actively maintained and has a growing ecosystem of plugins and tools that enhance its functionality.

#### Trade-offs

- **pnpm vs. npm**:
    - **npm**: npm is the default package manager for Node.js and has a vast user base. It provides good performance but can suffer from issues related to dependency duplication and resolution conflicts. npm has made improvements over time, but pnpm’s unique approach to dependency management offers better performance and consistency.
    - **pnpm**: Provides improved performance and consistency but may require an initial transition period for teams familiar with npm.

- **pnpm vs. Yarn**:
    - **Yarn**: Yarn is known for its performance improvements over npm, including caching and parallel installs. However, pnpm often outperforms Yarn in terms of installation speed and dependency management due to its unique approach to storing packages.
    - **pnpm**: Offers superior performance and a more consistent dependency resolution process but may have a steeper learning curve for teams used to Yarn.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### pnpm

- **Pros**:
    - High performance with reduced installation times
    - Deterministic dependency resolution and consistent dependency trees
    - Efficient disk space usage through package deduplication
    - Supports monorepos and workspace management
    - Growing community and ecosystem support

- **Cons**:
    - May require an adjustment period for teams used to npm or Yarn
    - Slightly less widespread adoption compared to npm and Yarn

### npm

- **Pros**:
    - Default package manager for Node.js with widespread adoption
    - Large ecosystem and community support
    - Continuous improvements and updates

- **Cons**:
    - Can suffer from slower installation times and dependency resolution issues
    - Dependency duplication and conflicts can be problematic

### Yarn

- **Pros**:
    - Improved performance over npm with features like caching and parallel installs
    - Reliable dependency resolution with lock files

- **Cons**:
    - Slower installation times compared to pnpm in some scenarios
    - Some features may overlap with pnpm’s capabilities
