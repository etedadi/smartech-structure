# ADR: Charts for Large Scale React.js Project

## Context and Problem Statement

Effective charting and data visualization are crucial for providing insights and analytics in a large-scale React.js project. With over 100,000 users and diverse data requirements, the charting solution must handle various types of charts, support interactivity, and offer good performance for large datasets.

## Decision Drivers

1. **Chart Types**: The solution should support a wide range of chart types, including bar, line, pie, scatter, and more.
2. **Interactivity**: It should provide interactive features such as tooltips, zooming, and filtering.
3. **Performance**: The tool should handle large datasets efficiently and maintain good performance.
4. **Customization**: It should offer extensive customization options for chart appearance and behavior.
5. **Integration**: The charting library should integrate well with React and other parts of the application.
6. **Ease of Use**: It should be straightforward to set up and use, with good documentation and community support.

## Considered Options

1. **Recharts**
2. **Chart.js**
3. **D3.js**
4. **ApexCharts**
5. **ECharts**
6. **AmCharts**
7. **Nivo**

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen Tool: **Recharts**

#### Justification

- **Chart Types**: Recharts supports a wide range of chart types, including line, bar, pie, area, and scatter charts. It is suitable for various data visualization needs and allows for easy integration of multiple chart types within the same project.

- **Interactivity**: Recharts offers built-in interactive features such as tooltips, legends, and custom event handlers. It allows users to interact with charts and provides a good user experience.

- **Performance**: Recharts is optimized for performance and can handle reasonably large datasets efficiently. It leverages SVG for rendering, which is suitable for many use cases but may require additional considerations for extremely large datasets.

- **Customization**: Provides extensive customization options for chart appearance, including colors, labels, and tooltips. Users can easily customize chart components to fit their specific requirements.

- **Integration**: Integrates seamlessly with React, using React components for chart rendering. This makes it easy to use within a React application and integrate with other React-based tools and libraries.

- **Ease of Use**: Recharts has a simple and intuitive API, with good documentation and examples. It is easy to set up and use, even for developers who are new to charting libraries.

#### Trade-offs

- **Recharts vs. Chart.js**:
    - **Chart.js**: Provides a rich set of chart types and customization options, with good performance and interactivity. Requires integration with React through additional wrappers (e.g., `react-chartjs-2`), which can add complexity.
    - **Recharts**: Offers a more native React integration and simpler setup, making it easier to use within React projects.

- **Recharts vs. D3.js**:
    - **D3.js**: Extremely powerful and flexible, with a wide range of chart types and customizations. However, it has a steeper learning curve and requires more setup and configuration compared to Recharts.
    - **Recharts**: Provides a more straightforward and easier-to-use solution for common charting needs, with less complexity.

- **Recharts vs. ApexCharts**:
    - **ApexCharts**: Offers a wide range of interactive and highly customizable charts, with good performance and features. However, it is a more complex library and may be overkill for simpler charting requirements.
    - **Recharts**: Provides a simpler and more focused solution for common charting needs within React projects.

- **Recharts vs. ECharts**:
    - **ECharts**: Provides a rich set of features and supports various chart types, with good performance and customization options. It is also highly configurable but may require more setup and integration effort compared to Recharts.
    - **Recharts**: Easier to set up and use within React projects, with a focus on simplicity and React integration.

- **Recharts vs. AmCharts**:
    - **AmCharts**: Offers a comprehensive set of features and customization options, including interactive and complex chart types. It is highly flexible but may involve additional costs for full feature access.
    - **Recharts**: Provides a more straightforward and cost-effective solution for most charting needs, with a simpler API.

- **Recharts vs. Nivo**:
    - **Nivo**: Provides a wide range of highly customizable and interactive charts with good performance. It is based on D3.js but provides a simpler API for use with React. However, it has a steeper learning curve compared to Recharts.
    - **Recharts**: Easier to use and integrate within React projects, with a more focused and simpler API.
