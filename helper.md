# ADR: Helper Libraries

## Context and Problem Statement

In a large-scale React.js project, utilizing helper libraries can significantly improve developer productivity, reduce boilerplate code, and ensure adherence to best practices. The selection of appropriate helper libraries is crucial for maintaining code quality and accelerating development.

## Decision Drivers

1. **Utility**: Provides essential utility functions that simplify common tasks.
2. **Performance**: Efficient and performant, minimizing the impact on application performance.
3. **Community Support**: Widely used and well-maintained with good documentation.
4. **Compatibility**: Integrates well with React and other project dependencies.
5. **Ease of Use**: User-friendly API and minimal learning curve.

## Considered Options

1. **Lodash**
2. **Moment.js / date-fns**
3. **Axios**
4. **uuid**
5. **immer**
6. **validator**

### Option 1: Lodash

**Description**: Lodash is a modern JavaScript utility library delivering modularity, performance, and extras.

#### Pros
- **Comprehensive**: Provides a wide range of utility functions for common tasks.
- **Performance**: Optimized for performance with lazy evaluation and memoization.
- **Modular**: Allows importing specific functions to reduce bundle size.

#### Cons
- **Bundle Size**: Can be large if not used modularly.
- **Redundancy**: Some functions may be redundant with ES6 features.

### Option 2: Moment.js / date-fns

**Description**: Moment.js is a library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates. date-fns offers similar functionality but with a functional programming approach and smaller bundle size.

#### Pros
- **Comprehensive**: Extensive support for date and time manipulation.
- **Ease of Use**: Intuitive API for working with dates.

#### Cons (Moment.js)
- **Bundle Size**: Relatively large, impacting performance.
- **Deprecation**: Moment.js is in maintenance mode, with no new features planned.

#### Pros (date-fns)
- **Performance**: Smaller bundle size and functional programming approach.
- **Modular**: Import only the functions needed, reducing bundle size.

### Option 3: Axios

**Description**: Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.

#### Pros
- **Ease of Use**: Simple API for making HTTP requests.
- **Interceptors**: Support for request and response interceptors.
- **Compatibility**: Works well with modern JavaScript environments.

#### Cons
- **Bundle Size**: Adds to the bundle size compared to native fetch API.
- **Configuration Overhead**: Requires setup for advanced use cases.

### Option 4: uuid

**Description**: uuid is a library for generating RFC-compliant UUIDs.

#### Pros
- **Simplicity**: Easy to use for generating unique identifiers.
- **Performance**: Lightweight and performant.
- **Compatibility**: Works well in browser and Node.js environments.

#### Cons
- **Limited Scope**: Only generates UUIDs, not a general utility library.

### Option 5: immer

**Description**: Immer is a library that allows you to work with immutable state in a more convenient way.

#### Pros
- **Ease of Use**: Simplifies handling immutable state.
- **Performance**: Efficient handling of immutable data structures.
- **Integration**: Works well with Redux and other state management libraries.

#### Cons
- **Bundle Size**: Adds to the bundle size.
- **Learning Curve**: Requires understanding of its concepts and API.

### Option 6: validator

**Description**: validator is a library for string validation and sanitization.

#### Pros
- **Comprehensive**: Provides a wide range of validation and sanitization functions.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple API for common validation tasks.
- **Performance**: Efficient and lightweight.

#### Cons
- **Limited Scope**: Focused solely on string validation and sanitization.

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen Approach: **Combination of Lodash, date-fns, Axios, uuid, immer, and validator**

For our large-scale React.js project, we recommend the following helper libraries:

- **Lodash**: For its comprehensive utility functions and performance optimizations.
- **date-fns**: For date and time manipulation, due to its functional approach and smaller bundle size.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests, thanks to its simplicity and features like interceptors.
- **uuid**: For generating unique identifiers in a simple and efficient manner.
- **immer**: For managing immutable state in a more convenient and performant way.
- **validator**: For comprehensive string validation and sanitization.

This combination provides a robust set of tools to enhance productivity, maintain code quality, and manage common tasks effectively.
