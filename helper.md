# ADR: Helper Libraries for Large Scale React.js Project

## Context and Problem Statement

Helper libraries are essential for enhancing productivity and streamlining development in large-scale React.js projects. They can provide utilities for common tasks, simplify code, and improve maintainability. Selecting appropriate helper libraries is crucial for ensuring consistency and efficiency across the development team.

## Decision Drivers

1. **Utility**: Libraries should provide useful functions or features that address common development needs.
2. **Compatibility**: Libraries should be compatible with React and other technologies used in the project.
3. **Performance**: Libraries should be efficient and not introduce performance bottlenecks.
4. **Maintainability**: Libraries should be well-maintained and actively supported.
5. **Ease of Use**: Libraries should be easy to integrate and use within the project.
6. **Community Support**: Libraries with a strong community and good documentation are preferred.

## Considered Options

1. **Lodash**
2. **Date-fns / Moment.js**
3. **axios / fetch**
4. **classnames**
5. **react-query / SWR**
6. **yup / Joi**

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen Approach: **Lodash, Date-fns, axios, classnames, react-query, and yup**

#### Justification

- **Lodash**: Provides a wide range of utility functions for common programming tasks, such as data manipulation and object handling. It helps simplify complex tasks and ensures consistent code.

- **Date-fns**: A modern alternative to Moment.js for handling dates and times. It offers a modular approach, allowing you to import only the functions you need, which helps reduce bundle size and improve performance. Moment.js is deprecated in favor of more modern libraries, making Date-fns a preferable choice.

- **axios**: A popular HTTP client for making requests. It offers a straightforward API and supports features such as interceptors and request/response transformation. `fetch` is another option, but `axios` provides a more feature-rich experience and better error handling.

- **classnames**: A utility for conditionally joining class names together. It simplifies the management of dynamic class names in React components, improving readability and maintainability.

- **react-query**: Provides powerful hooks for data fetching, caching, and synchronization. It simplifies server-state management and helps reduce boilerplate code related to data fetching and caching.

- **yup**: A schema validation library that integrates well with Formik for form validation. It provides a fluent API for defining complex validation schemas and handling validation logic.

#### Trade-offs

- **Lodash vs. Native JavaScript**:
    - **Native JavaScript**: Modern JavaScript has incorporated many features that Lodash provides, such as array methods and object manipulation. For simple tasks, native JavaScript may be sufficient and reduce dependencies.
    - **Lodash**: Offers a comprehensive set of utilities, making it easier to handle more complex scenarios and maintain consistent code.

- **Date-fns vs. Moment.js**:
    - **Moment.js**: While it is widely used, Moment.js is large and has been deprecated in favor of more modern solutions.
    - **Date-fns**: Provides a more modular and lightweight approach, aligning with modern development practices.

- **axios vs. fetch**:
    - **fetch**: A built-in browser API for making HTTP requests. It is native and has a simpler API but lacks some of the advanced features and error handling provided by `axios`.
    - **axios**: Offers a more feature-rich API and better error handling, making it a preferred choice for many developers.

- **react-query vs. SWR**:
    - **SWR**: Another library for data fetching with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. It is similar to `react-query` but may have fewer features.
    - **react-query**: Provides a more comprehensive set of features for caching, synchronization, and data management, making it more suitable for complex use cases.

- **yup vs. Joi**:
    - **Joi**: A powerful validation library with a rich set of features but is not as commonly used in React projects.
    - **yup**: Integrates seamlessly with Formik and provides a more React-centric approach to schema validation.
