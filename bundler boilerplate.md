# ADR: Bundler / Boilerplate for Large Scale React.js Project

## Context and Problem Statement

Selecting the right bundler and boilerplate setup is crucial for efficiently managing a large-scale React.js project. With over 100,000 users and complex UI components, the choice of bundler and boilerplate affects build performance, development workflow, and overall project maintainability.

## Decision Drivers

1. **Build Performance**: The bundler should efficiently handle large codebases and optimize build times.
2. **Developer Experience**: The setup should streamline the development process and provide useful tools and configurations.
3. **Scalability**: The bundler should support scaling the project as it grows and integrates with various tools and libraries.
4. **Configuration**: The boilerplate should offer a sensible default configuration that can be easily customized as needed.
5. **Community and Ecosystem**: The bundler and boilerplate should have strong community support and integration with popular tools and libraries.

## Considered Options

1. **Webpack**
2. **Vite**
3. **Create React App (CRA)**
4. **Next.js Boilerplate**

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen Bundler/Boilerplate: **Next.js Boilerplate**

#### Justification

- **Next.js Boilerplate**:
    - **Build Performance**: Next.js provides built-in optimizations such as automatic code splitting, static site generation, and server-side rendering, which improve performance and load times. Its built-in bundling capabilities are well-optimized for both development and production environments.
    - **Developer Experience**: Next.js offers a rich development experience with features like hot module replacement, fast refresh, and an integrated development server. It also simplifies routing and server-side rendering, which can enhance productivity and streamline development.
    - **Scalability**: Next.js is designed to handle large-scale applications and offers features like API routes, custom server configurations, and static generation that support scaling the project effectively.
    - **Configuration**: The Next.js boilerplate provides sensible defaults and allows for easy customization through configuration files and plugins. It also integrates well with popular tools and libraries, reducing the need for extensive configuration.
    - **Community and Ecosystem**: Next.js has a strong community and ecosystem, with extensive documentation, plugins, and integrations available. This support helps in resolving issues quickly and staying up-to-date with best practices.

#### Trade-offs

- **Next.js vs. Webpack**:
    - **Webpack**: While Webpack offers fine-grained control over the build process and extensive plugin support, it requires significant configuration and setup. It may be more complex to manage and maintain for large-scale projects compared to the more streamlined Next.js approach.
    - **Next.js**: Provides a more opinionated setup with built-in features that streamline development and improve performance. It may limit some flexibility compared to a custom Webpack configuration but simplifies many aspects of project setup and optimization.

- **Next.js vs. Vite**:
    - **Vite**: Offers fast build times and a modern development experience with features like on-demand compilation and hot module replacement. However, it is a newer tool and might have less mature ecosystem support compared to Next.js.
    - **Next.js**: Provides a more established framework with robust server-side rendering and static site generation features. It has a broader community and ecosystem, making it a more reliable choice for complex, large-scale projects.

- **Next.js vs. Create React App (CRA)**:
    - **CRA**: Provides a simple and quick setup for React projects but lacks built-in server-side rendering and static site generation features. It is more suited for smaller projects and might require additional configuration for scaling and advanced features.
    - **Next.js**: Offers a more comprehensive feature set that includes server-side rendering, static generation, and optimized performance out of the box, making it better suited for large-scale applications.

## Pros and Cons of the Options
