# ADR: Bundler / Boilerplate

## Context and Problem Statement

In our large-scale React.js project, we need a reliable and efficient bundler and boilerplate setup to streamline the development process. The chosen bundler should handle the complexities of modern JavaScript applications, optimize performance, and integrate well with our existing tools and workflows. A robust boilerplate will ensure a consistent and scalable project structure.

## Decision Drivers

1. **Performance**: Efficiently handles large codebases and optimizes for fast load times.
2. **Ease of Use**: Simple setup and developer-friendly tooling.
3. **Customizability**: Allows for extensive customization to fit our specific project needs.
4. **Community Support**: Active community and good documentation.
5. **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with React, Next.js, and other tools in our tech stack.

## Considered Options

1. **Webpack**
2. **Parcel**
3. **Vite**
4. **Create React App (CRA)**
5. **Next.js**
6. **Gatsby**

#### Pros
- **Ease of Use**: No configuration required for basic use cases.
- **Performance**: Fast bundling with built-in optimizations.
- **Developer Experience**: Simple and quick to get started.

#### Cons
- **Customizability**: Less flexible compared to Webpack for complex configurations.
- **Community Size**: Smaller community and ecosystem compared to Webpack.

### Option 3: Vite

**Description**: Vite is a next-generation front-end tooling that provides a fast development experience.

#### Pros
- **Performance**: Extremely fast bundling and hot module replacement (HMR).
- **Simplicity**: Minimal configuration required.
- **Modern Features**: Supports ES modules and modern JavaScript features.

#### Cons
- **Maturity**: Newer and less mature compared to Webpack.
- **Community Size**: Smaller community and ecosystem compared to Webpack.

### Option 4: Create React App (CRA)

**Description**: Create React App is a boilerplate setup for React applications that uses Webpack under the hood.

#### Pros
- **Ease of Use**: Simple and opinionated setup for React applications.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with React.
- **Community Support**: Backed by Facebook and widely used in the React community.

#### Cons
- **Customization**: Limited out-of-the-box customization; requires ejecting for advanced configurations.
- **Performance**: Can be less performant compared to more customized setups.

### Option 5: Next.js

**Description**: Next.js is a React framework that provides server-side rendering, static site generation, and more.

#### Pros
- **Performance**: Optimized for performance with server-side rendering and static generation.
- **Features**: Built-in support for routing, API routes, and internationalization.
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent developer experience with minimal configuration.

#### Cons
- **Complexity**: More complex than CRA for simple applications.
- **Learning Curve**: Requires learning Next.js-specific features and conventions.

### Option 6: Gatsby

**Description**: Gatsby is a React-based framework for building static sites and applications.

#### Pros
- **Performance**: Optimized for performance with static site generation.
- **Plugins**: Extensive plugin ecosystem for adding functionality.
- **Community**: Large and active community with good documentation.

#### Cons
- **Build Time**: Can have long build times for large sites.
- **Complexity**: More complex setup compared to CRA for dynamic applications.

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen Approach: **Combination of Webpack and Next.js**

For our large-scale React.js project, we recommend using **Webpack** in combination with **Next.js**:

- **Webpack**: Provides the flexibility and performance optimizations needed for our project. Its extensive plugin ecosystem allows us to customize the build process to fit our specific requirements.
- **Next.js**: Offers server-side rendering, static site generation, and built-in routing, which are beneficial for our project's performance and SEO. It also integrates seamlessly with React and Webpack.

This combination ensures that we have a powerful and flexible bundler in Webpack, along with the modern features and performance optimizations provided by Next.js.
