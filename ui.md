# ADR: UI Kit

## Context

We need to standardize the UI components across our enterprise-level projects to ensure consistency, maintainability, and scalability. Currently, we are using Ant Design for most of our projects and Material-UI for some.

## Decision Drivers

1. **Consistency**: Ensuring a uniform look and feel across all projects.
2. **Scalability**: Ability to grow and adapt as the product evolves.
3. **Maintainability**: Ease of maintenance and updates.
4. **Developer Experience**: Ease of use and integration for developers.
5. **Performance**: Efficient rendering and responsiveness.
6. **Flexibility**: Capability to handle diverse and complex UI requirements.

## Considered Options

1. **Ant Design**
2. **Material-UI**
3. **Chakra UI**
4. **Semantic UI**
5. **Custom Component Library**

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen option: **Ant Design**

#### Justification

- **Consistency**: Ant Design provides a comprehensive set of high-quality components that ensure a consistent design language across all projects.
- **Scalability**: It is designed to handle large-scale applications with complex UI requirements, making it suitable for our advanced user panels.
- **Maintainability**: Ant Design has a well-documented API and strong community support, which simplifies maintenance and updates.
- **Developer Experience**: Our developers are already familiar with Ant Design, reducing the learning curve and improving productivity.
- **Performance**: Ant Design components are optimized for performance, ensuring efficient rendering and responsiveness.
- **Flexibility**: It offers a wide range of customizable components, allowing us to meet diverse and complex UI needs.

#### Trade-offs

- **Flexibility vs. Consistency**: While Ant Design offers flexibility, it might not provide the same level of customization as a fully custom component library. However, the trade-off is acceptable given the benefits in consistency and developer experience.
- **Learning Curve**: For projects currently using Material-UI, there will be an initial learning curve to switch to Ant Design. However, this is mitigated by the overall benefits of standardization.

## Pros and Cons of the Options
