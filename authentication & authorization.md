# ADR: Authentication & Authorization for Large Scale React.js Project

## Context and Problem Statement

Authentication and authorization are critical components for securing access to a large-scale React.js application. Given the scale of the project with over 100,000 users, robust and scalable solutions are necessary to manage user identities, permissions, and secure access to various parts of the application.

## Decision Drivers

1. **Security**: The solution must ensure secure handling of authentication and authorization processes.
2. **Scalability**: It should support a large number of users and scale as the project grows.
3. **Ease of Integration**: The solution should integrate well with React and other parts of the application.
4. **User Experience**: It should provide a smooth and user-friendly authentication experience.
5. **Flexibility**: The solution should support various authentication methods and authorization requirements.
6. **Compliance**: It should meet any necessary regulatory and compliance requirements.

## Considered Options

1. **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect**
2. **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**
3. **Auth0**
4. **Firebase Authentication**
5. **Custom Authentication System**

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen Approach: **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect with JWT**

#### Justification

- **Security**: OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect are industry-standard protocols for secure authentication and authorization. They provide robust mechanisms for managing access tokens and ensuring secure communication between clients and servers. JWT (JSON Web Tokens) is a widely-used standard for securely transmitting information between parties and is well-suited for use with OAuth 2.0.

- **Scalability**: OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect are scalable protocols that can handle large numbers of users and scale with the application. JWTs are stateless and can be easily scaled across distributed systems without requiring server-side session storage.

- **Ease of Integration**: Both OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect integrate well with modern web applications and can be used with React through available libraries and SDKs. JWTs can be easily handled within a React application using popular libraries.

- **User Experience**: OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect support various authentication methods, including social logins (e.g., Google, Facebook) and Single Sign-On (SSO), providing a seamless user experience.

- **Flexibility**: OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect offer flexibility in managing different authorization scenarios, including role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC). JWTs support custom claims and can be tailored to fit specific authorization requirements.

- **Compliance**: OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect are widely adopted standards that comply with modern security practices. They help ensure compliance with regulations such as GDPR by providing mechanisms for secure user data management.

#### Trade-offs

- **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect vs. Auth0**:
    - **Auth0**: Provides a comprehensive identity management solution with built-in support for OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and other authentication methods. While it offers extensive features and ease of use, it involves additional costs and introduces dependency on a third-party service.
    - **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect with JWT**: Offers flexibility and control over the authentication and authorization process but requires implementation and management of the identity provider and associated infrastructure.

- **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect vs. Firebase Authentication**:
    - **Firebase Authentication**: Provides a user-friendly and easy-to-integrate solution with built-in support for various authentication methods, including email/password and social logins. However, it is tied to the Firebase ecosystem and may not offer the same level of flexibility as a custom OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect implementation.
    - **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect with JWT**: Provides more flexibility and control over the authentication process, allowing for integration with various identity providers and custom implementations.

- **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect vs. Custom Authentication System**:
    - **Custom Authentication System**: Offers complete control over authentication and authorization processes but requires significant development effort, security considerations, and maintenance.
    - **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect with JWT**: Provides a standardized and secure approach with extensive support and community resources, reducing the need for custom development and ensuring adherence to industry best practices.

## Pros and Cons of the Options
