# ADR: Authentication & Authorization for Large Scale React.js Project

## Context and Problem Statement

In our large-scale React.js project, we need a robust solution for authentication and authorization to secure the application and manage user access effectively. The chosen solution must be scalable, integrate seamlessly with our tech stack, and provide comprehensive security features.

## Decision Drivers

1. **Security**: Ensures the application is secure against common vulnerabilities.
2. **Scalability**: Can handle a large number of users and scale with the application.
3. **Ease of Integration**: Integrates well with React and our existing infrastructure.
4. **Customization**: Allows for customization to fit our specific requirements.
5. **Community Support**: Active community and good documentation.
6. **User Experience**: Provides a smooth and secure user experience.

## Considered Options

1. **Firebase Authentication**
2. **Auth0**
3. **AWS Cognito**
4. **Keycloak**
5. **Custom JWT-Based Authentication**

### Option 1: Firebase Authentication

**Description**: Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users.

#### Pros
- **Ease of Use**: Simple to set up and integrate with React.
- **Features**: Supports multiple authentication providers (email/password, social logins, etc.).
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale with the application.

#### Cons
- **Vendor Lock-In**: Ties the application to Firebase services.
- **Customization**: Limited customization compared to self-hosted solutions.

### Option 2: Auth0

**Description**: Auth0 is a flexible, drop-in solution to add authentication and authorization services to your applications.

#### Pros
- **Ease of Use**: Easy to set up and integrate with React.
- **Features**: Rich feature set, including multifactor authentication, social logins, and enterprise federation.
- **Scalability**: Can handle large-scale applications.

#### Cons
- **Cost**: Can become expensive as the number of users increases.
- **Vendor Lock-In**: Relies on a third-party service.

### Option 3: AWS Cognito

**Description**: AWS Cognito provides authentication, authorization, and user management for web and mobile apps.

#### Pros
- **Scalability**: Built to scale with AWS infrastructure.
- **Integration**: Integrates well with other AWS services.
- **Features**: Supports user pools, identity pools, and multifactor authentication.

#### Cons
- **Complexity**: Can be complex to set up and manage.
- **Cost**: Costs can increase with the number of users and features.

### Option 4: Keycloak

**Description**: Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management solution.

#### Pros
- **Customization**: Highly customizable and self-hosted.
- **Features**: Supports SSO, social logins, multifactor authentication, and more.
- **Community**: Active open-source community.

#### Cons
- **Complexity**: Requires setup and maintenance.
- **Resources**: Requires additional resources to manage the infrastructure.

### Option 5: Custom JWT-Based Authentication

**Description**: Implementing a custom authentication system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

#### Pros
- **Customization**: Fully customizable to meet specific requirements.
- **Control**: Complete control over the authentication flow and data.

#### Cons
- **Complexity**: Requires significant development and maintenance effort.
- **Security**: Must ensure proper implementation to avoid security vulnerabilities.

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen Approach: **Combination of AWS Cognito and Custom JWT-Based Authentication**

For our large-scale React.js project, we recommend using **AWS Cognito** in combination with a **Custom JWT-Based Authentication**:

- **AWS Cognito**: Provides a scalable, secure, and feature-rich solution for authentication and user management. It integrates well with our existing AWS infrastructure and offers support for multifactor authentication, social logins, and more.
- **Custom JWT-Based Authentication**: Allows us to implement specific customizations and business logic that AWS Cognito might not cover. This provides flexibility and control over the authentication flow while leveraging AWS Cognito for user management and security.

This combination ensures a robust, scalable, and secure authentication and authorization solution that fits our project requirements.
