# ADR: State Management for Large Scale React.js Project

## Context and Problem Statement

Effective state management is crucial for maintaining consistency and performance in our large-scale React.js project. With around 100,000 users and complex data interactions, selecting the right state management approach is vital to ensure scalability and maintainability. Our project is currently using Redux Toolkit and React Context API, and switching to other solutions would incur additional costs.

## Decision Drivers

1. **Complexity**: Ability to manage complex state interactions effectively.
2. **Scalability**: Supports the growth of state management as the project expands.
3. **Performance**: Ensures efficient state updates and rendering.
4. **Maintainability**: Keeps the codebase manageable and understandable.
5. **Cost**: Considers the cost of switching to new state management solutions.

## Considered Options

1. **Redux Toolkit**
2. **React Context API**
3. **Zustand**
4. **LegendApp**
5. **Recoil**
6. **MobX**

### Option 1: Redux Toolkit

**Description**: Redux Toolkit is the official, recommended way to use Redux. It simplifies Redux usage with a set of tools and best practices for managing state.

#### Pros
- **Established**: Well-established and widely used with a strong ecosystem.
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with middleware, DevTools, and other Redux libraries.
- **Predictable State**: Offers predictable state updates and centralized state management.
- **Current Use**: Already integrated into the project, reducing the need for transition efforts.

#### Cons
- **Boilerplate**: Requires some boilerplate code, although Redux Toolkit reduces this significantly.
- **Learning Curve**: Requires a good understanding of Redux concepts, which might be challenging for new developers.

### Option 2: React Context API

**Description**: React Context API allows you to manage state without external libraries, using context providers and consumers.

#### Pros
- **Built-In**: No need for additional libraries, leveraging React's built-in capabilities.
- **Simplicity**: Simple to set up and use for small to moderate state management needs.
- **Current Use**: Already implemented, which avoids the cost of transitioning.

#### Cons
- **Performance**: Can lead to performance issues with frequent updates or deeply nested components.
- **Scalability**: Less suitable for managing complex state compared to Redux or other libraries.

### Option 3: Zustand

**Description**: Zustand is a minimalistic state management library that focuses on simplicity and performance, providing a fast and easy-to-use solution.

#### Pros
- **Lightweight**: Minimalistic and requires minimal setup, with low overhead.
- **Performance**: High performance with quick state updates and efficient rendering.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple API and intuitive for developers familiar with React.

#### Cons
- **Limited Ecosystem**: Smaller ecosystem compared to Redux, which might limit available resources and community support.
- **Transition Cost**: Requires learning and integration time, which could incur costs given the existing use of Redux Toolkit and Context API.

### Option 4: LegendApp

**Description**: LegendApp is designed for complex state management scenarios, offering advanced features and tools.

#### Pros
- **Advanced Features**: Includes sophisticated state management tools and capabilities.
- **Integration**: Can be integrated with various frameworks and libraries.

#### Cons
- **Complexity**: May add additional complexity and a learning curve for the development team.
- **Ecosystem**: Less widely adopted compared to other state management libraries, which could affect community support and resources.
- **Transition Cost**: Significant transition effort and cost due to the existing Redux Toolkit setup.

### Option 5: Recoil

**Description**: Recoil provides a novel approach to state management in React with atoms and selectors, offering fine-grained control.

#### Pros
- **Fine-Grained Control**: Allows detailed state management with atoms and selectors.
- **Concurrency**: Manages asynchronous state and queries efficiently.

#### Cons
- **Newer Library**: Less mature and may have limited community resources and support.
- **Integration Cost**: Switching from Redux Toolkit would involve transition costs and potential integration challenges.

### Option 6: MobX

**Description**: MobX uses observables for state management, providing a reactive programming model to keep the UI in sync with the state.

#### Pros
- **Reactive**: Reactive approach simplifies keeping the UI in sync with state changes.
- **Ease of Use**: Offers a simple and intuitive API with less boilerplate compared to Redux.

#### Cons
- **Learning Curve**: Requires understanding of MobXâ€™s reactive programming model, which may be a shift for developers used to Redux.
- **Integration Cost**: Transitioning to MobX from the current setup would involve costs and integration effort.

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen Approach: **Continue with Redux Toolkit and React Context API**

Given the current use of **Redux Toolkit** and **React Context API**, and the costs associated with switching to new state management solutions, we recommend continuing with these existing tools:

- **Redux Toolkit**: Best suited for managing complex state interactions and middleware integration. Its integration is already established, which avoids additional costs.
- **React Context API**: Adequate for simpler state management scenarios and already implemented, reducing the need for further changes.

This approach maintains stability and minimizes costs while ensuring effective state management.
