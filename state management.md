# ADR: State Management

## Context and Problem Statement

In a large-scale React.js project, effective state management is crucial for maintaining a clean, maintainable, and scalable codebase. The chosen state management solution should help manage both local component state and global application state efficiently.

## Decision Drivers

1. **Scalability**: The state management solution should scale with the application's growth.
2. **Ease of Use**: It should be easy for developers to learn and implement.
3. **Performance**: The solution should not introduce significant performance overhead.
4. **Community and Ecosystem**: Strong community support and a rich ecosystem of tools and libraries.
5. **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing and future libraries and frameworks.

## Considered Options

1. **Redux**
2. **Context API**
3. **MobX**
4. **Recoil**

### Option 1: Redux

Redux is a popular state management library that provides a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It emphasizes strict unidirectional data flow and a single source of truth.

#### Pros
- **Predictability**: Provides a single source of truth and predictable state changes.
- **Debugging**: Excellent debugging tools such as Redux DevTools.
- **Middleware**: Supports middleware for handling side effects, making it powerful for complex state logic.
- **Community**: Large community, extensive documentation, and numerous third-party libraries.

#### Cons
- **Boilerplate**: Can introduce significant boilerplate code, making it heavy for simple state management needs.
- **Learning Curve**: Steeper learning curve for new developers due to its concepts and patterns.

### Option 2: Context API

The Context API is a built-in React feature that allows passing data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

#### Pros
- **Simplicity**: Simple and easy to use, especially for smaller applications or localized state.
- **No Additional Libraries**: No need to install and configure external libraries.
- **Performance**: Lightweight and minimal performance overhead.

#### Cons
- **Scalability**: Can become unwieldy for managing complex or large-scale application state.
- **Debugging**: Less robust debugging tools compared to Redux.

### Option 3: MobX

MobX is a state management library that makes state management simple and scalable by using reactive programming.

#### Pros
- **Simplicity**: Less boilerplate compared to Redux, making it easier to implement.
- **Performance**: Efficient and optimized for performance due to its reactive nature.
- **Scalability**: Scales well with application complexity.

#### Cons
- **Debugging**: Less mature debugging tools compared to Redux.
- **Learning Curve**: Requires understanding of reactive programming concepts.

### Option 4: Recoil

Recoil is a state management library for React that provides a set of utilities for managing both global and local state with a focus on simplicity and performance.

#### Pros
- **Simplicity**: Minimal boilerplate and easy to use.
- **Performance**: Optimized for performance with a fine-grained subscription model.
- **Integration**: Designed specifically for React, ensuring seamless integration.

#### Cons
- **Maturity**: Relatively new and less mature compared to Redux, with a smaller community and fewer resources.
- **Ecosystem**: Fewer third-party libraries and tools compared to Redux.

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen Approach: **Combination of Redux and Context API**

After evaluating the options, we have decided to adopt a combination of **Redux** and the **Context API** for our state management needs. This approach leverages the strengths of both solutions:

- **Redux** will be used for managing complex global application state, where predictability, middleware support, and robust debugging tools are essential. Its large community and extensive ecosystem also provide a wealth of resources and tools.
- **Context API** will be used for managing localized state within specific components or sections of the application. Its simplicity and minimal overhead make it ideal for these scenarios.

This combination allows us to maintain a scalable and maintainable state management strategy, balancing complexity and performance with ease of use.
