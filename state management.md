# ADR: State Management for Large Scale React.js Project

## Context and Problem Statement

Effective state management is crucial for maintaining consistency and performance in our large-scale React.js project. With around 100,000 users and complex data interactions, selecting the right state management approach is vital to ensure scalability and maintainability. Our project is currently using Redux Toolkit and React Context API, and switching to other solutions would incur additional costs.

## Decision Drivers

1. **Complexity**: Ability to manage complex state interactions effectively.
2. **Scalability**: Supports the growth of state management as the project expands.
3. **Performance**: Ensures efficient state updates and rendering.
4. **Maintainability**: Keeps the codebase manageable and understandable.
5. **Cost**: Considers the cost of switching to new state management solutions.

## Considered Options

1. **Redux Toolkit**
2. **React Context API**
3. **Zustand**
4. **LegendApp**
5. **Recoil**
6. **MobX**

### Option 1: Redux Toolkit

**Description**: Redux Toolkit is the official, recommended way to use Redux. It simplifies Redux usage with a set of tools and best practices for managing state.

#### Pros
- **Robust**: Provides a well-established, robust state management solution.
- **Integration**: Works well with middleware and DevTools.
- **Predictability**: Offers predictable state updates and centralized state management.
- **Current Use**: Already in use, minimizing additional costs.

#### Cons
- **Boilerplate**: Can involve boilerplate code, though Redux Toolkit reduces this.
- **Learning Curve**: Requires understanding of Redux concepts and patterns.

### Option 2: React Context API

**Description**: React Context API allows you to manage state without external libraries, using context providers and consumers.

#### Pros
- **Simplicity**: Simple to set up and use for smaller state management needs.
- **Built-in**: No need for additional libraries or dependencies.
- **Current Use**: Already in use, reducing transition costs.

#### Cons
- **Performance**: May lead to performance issues with deeply nested components or frequent updates.
- **Scalability**: Less suitable for large-scale state management compared to Redux or other solutions.

### Option 3: Zustand

**Description**: Zustand is a small, fast state management library that provides a minimal API and focuses on simplicity and performance.

#### Pros
- **Lightweight**: Minimalistic and easy to use, with low overhead.
- **Performance**: High performance with quick state updates and no unnecessary re-renders.
- **Flexibility**: Provides a simple API that can be easily integrated into existing projects.

#### Cons
- **Limited Ecosystem**: Smaller ecosystem and less community support compared to Redux.
- **Learning Curve**: Requires additional learning for teams already familiar with Redux and Context.

### Option 4: LegendApp

**Description**: LegendApp is a state management solution with a focus on simplicity and ease of integration, suitable for complex applications with advanced state requirements.

#### Pros
- **Advanced Features**: Provides advanced state management features and tools.
- **Integration**: Integrates well with various front-end frameworks and libraries.

#### Cons
- **Complexity**: May introduce additional complexity and a learning curve.
- **Ecosystem**: Less widely used compared to more established state management libraries.

### Option 5: Recoil

**Description**: Recoil is a state management library for React that offers a new approach to handling state with atoms and selectors.

#### Pros
- **Fine-Grained Control**: Provides fine-grained control over state and derived state.
- **Concurrency**: Handles asynchronous queries and state management efficiently.

#### Cons
- **New**: Relatively new and may have less community support and resources.
- **Integration Cost**: Transitioning from existing solutions may incur additional costs.

### Option 6: MobX

**Description**: MobX is a state management library that uses observables to manage state in a reactive way.

#### Pros
- **Reactive**: Provides a reactive approach to state management, making it easy to keep the UI in sync with the state.
- **Simplicity**: Simple API and less boilerplate compared to Redux.

#### Cons
- **Learning Curve**: Requires learning its reactive programming model.
- **Integration Cost**: Switching to MobX involves costs and adjustments from the current setup.

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen Approach: **Continue with Redux Toolkit and React Context API**

Given that our project is already using **Redux Toolkit** and **React Context API**, and considering the costs associated with switching to new state management solutions, we recommend continuing with these existing tools:

- **Redux Toolkit**: Ideal for handling complex state interactions and maintaining predictable state updates. Itâ€™s already integrated, which helps avoid additional costs.
- **React Context API**: Suitable for simpler state management needs and already in use, minimizing the need for further changes.

By sticking with Redux Toolkit and React Context API, we ensure stability and reduce the costs associated with transitioning to other state management solutions.
