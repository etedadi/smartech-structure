# ADR: State Management for Large Scale React.js Project

## Context and Problem Statement

Effective state management is crucial for maintaining the performance and scalability of a large-scale React.js project. Our application, with over 100,000 users and complex user panels, requires a robust state management solution that can handle complex state interactions, provide performance optimizations, and support a large team of developers.

## Decision Drivers

1. **Performance**: The state management solution should efficiently handle large amounts of data and minimize unnecessary re-renders.
2. **Scalability**: It should support the growth of the application and handle increasing complexity without major refactoring.
3. **Developer Experience**: The solution should be intuitive and improve the productivity of the development team.
4. **Integration**: It should integrate well with existing libraries, frameworks, and tools used in the project.
5. **Maintainability**: The state management approach should facilitate code maintenance and updates over time.

## Considered Options

1. **Redux**
2. **React Context API**
3. **Recoil**
4. **Zustand**
5. **MobX**

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen State Management Solution: **Redux with Toolkit and React Context API**

#### Justification

- **Redux with Toolkit**:
    - **Performance**: Redux with Redux Toolkit offers optimized performance through efficient state management and middleware support. The Toolkit simplifies the configuration and reduces boilerplate code, improving overall efficiency.
    - **Scalability**: Redux is well-suited for handling complex state interactions and large-scale applications. Redux Toolkit provides a set of best practices and utilities for managing state in a scalable manner.
    - **Developer Experience**: Redux Toolkit simplifies Redux usage by providing pre-configured tools and a more intuitive API. This improves developer productivity and reduces the learning curve associated with Redux.
    - **Integration**: Redux integrates well with React and other libraries, including support for middleware and asynchronous actions. It also has a strong ecosystem of tools and plugins.
    - **Maintainability**: Redux’s clear and predictable state management pattern helps maintain code quality and consistency. Redux Toolkit’s best practices support maintainable codebases.

- **React Context API**:
    - **Performance**: Context API is useful for managing global state in a way that avoids prop drilling. However, for very large and complex state, it may cause performance issues due to unnecessary re-renders.
    - **Scalability**: React Context API is suitable for managing simple global state and works well in combination with Redux for more complex scenarios. It is ideal for managing UI-related state or less frequently updated data.
    - **Developer Experience**: Provides a straightforward API for managing global state. When used with Redux, it can be effective for managing simpler states or configurations.
    - **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with React components and can be used alongside Redux or other state management libraries.
    - **Maintainability**: Context API helps avoid prop drilling but may require careful management of performance to avoid re-render issues in large applications.

#### Trade-offs

- **Redux with Toolkit vs. Recoil**:
    - **Recoil**: Offers a more modern and flexible state management solution with fine-grained reactivity and built-in support for derived state. However, it is less mature compared to Redux and may have a smaller ecosystem and community.
    - **Redux with Toolkit**: Provides a well-established and mature solution with extensive tooling and community support. It may involve more boilerplate but offers stability and predictability in large-scale applications.

- **Redux with Toolkit vs. Zustand**:
    - **Zustand**: Offers a minimalistic and performant approach to state management with a simple API. It can be less complex than Redux but may lack some advanced features and ecosystem support.
    - **Redux with Toolkit**: Offers a more comprehensive state management solution with built-in utilities and best practices. It may be more suitable for complex state interactions and larger applications.

- **Redux with Toolkit vs. MobX**:
    - **MobX**: Provides a reactive and observable-based approach to state management, which can be easier to use for certain use cases. However, it can introduce complexity with observable state and may not integrate as seamlessly with Redux-based workflows.
    - **Redux with Toolkit**: Offers a predictable state management pattern and extensive tooling. It is well-suited for applications requiring clear and consistent state management practices.
