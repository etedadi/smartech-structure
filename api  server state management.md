# ADR: API / Server State Management for Large Scale React.js Project

## Context and Problem Statement

Managing API and server state efficiently is crucial for ensuring data consistency, performance, and scalability in a large-scale React.js project. With over 100,000 users and complex data interactions, the solution for API and server state management needs to handle data fetching, caching, synchronization, and error handling effectively.

## Decision Drivers

1. **Data Fetching**: The solution should efficiently handle data fetching from APIs, including support for various request types and handling of asynchronous operations.
2. **Caching**: It should provide caching mechanisms to reduce the number of API calls and improve performance.
3. **Synchronization**: The tool should manage synchronization of server data with client-side state, including handling updates and invalidations.
4. **Error Handling**: The solution should support comprehensive error handling and reporting for API interactions.
5. **Scalability**: It should scale with the applicationâ€™s data requirements and complexity.
6. **Integration**: The tool should integrate seamlessly with the existing state management solution and other parts of the application.

## Considered Options

1. **React Query**
2. **Apollo Client**
3. **SWAPI (Service Worker API)**
4. **Axios with Redux Toolkit Query**
5. **Relay**

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen Tool: **React Query**

#### Justification

- **Data Fetching**: React Query simplifies data fetching with built-in hooks and support for various request types (GET, POST, etc.). It abstracts away much of the boilerplate code associated with data fetching and provides a straightforward API for managing server state.

- **Caching**: React Query offers powerful caching capabilities, allowing data to be cached and automatically refreshed based on configurable intervals. This reduces the number of API calls and improves application performance.

- **Synchronization**: React Query handles data synchronization with the server by providing utilities for refetching, background updates, and invalidating cached data when necessary. It ensures that client-side data remains in sync with the server.

- **Error Handling**: Provides comprehensive error handling mechanisms, including automatic retries, error reporting, and customizable error handling logic. This helps manage API failures and improve the user experience.

- **Scalability**: React Query is designed to scale with large applications and handle complex data interactions efficiently. It manages caching and synchronization in a way that supports both small and large-scale projects.

- **Integration**: React Query integrates well with existing state management solutions like Redux and Context API. It can be used alongside other tools and fits seamlessly into the React ecosystem.

#### Trade-offs

- **React Query vs. Apollo Client**:
    - **Apollo Client**: Provides a robust solution for managing GraphQL data, including caching and real-time updates. It is well-suited for projects using GraphQL but may be more complex to set up and configure compared to React Query.
    - **React Query**: More focused on REST APIs and offers a simpler setup with built-in caching and synchronization features. It is more flexible for various API types and simpler to integrate.

- **React Query vs. Axios with Redux Toolkit Query**:
    - **Axios with Redux Toolkit Query**: Combines Axios for HTTP requests with Redux Toolkit Query for managing server state. While powerful, it involves additional setup and configuration compared to React Query.
    - **React Query**: Provides an all-in-one solution for data fetching and state management with less boilerplate and configuration.

- **React Query vs. Relay**:
    - **Relay**: A powerful framework for managing GraphQL data with a focus on data consistency and performance. It may be overkill for projects not using GraphQL and requires more extensive setup.
    - **React Query**: More general-purpose and suitable for a wide range of API types, making it a better fit for REST-based projects.

### Axios with Redux Toolkit Query

- **Pros**:
    - Combines Axios for HTTP requests with Redux Toolkit Query for server state management
    - Provides a powerful solution for managing server state

- **Cons**:
    - Additional setup and configuration required
    - More boilerplate compared to React Query

### Relay

- **Pros**:
    - Advanced data management for GraphQL
    - Strong focus on data consistency and performance

- **Cons**:
    - Requires a GraphQL backend
    - More complex setup and configuration
