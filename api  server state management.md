# ADR: API / Server State Management

## Context and Problem Statement

In our large-scale React.js project, managing the server state efficiently is critical to ensure a seamless user experience and maintain application performance. We need a robust solution to handle API requests, manage server state, and synchronize data between the client and server.

## Decision Drivers

1. **Performance**: Efficiently handles data fetching and caching.
2. **Ease of Use**: Simple setup and developer-friendly API.
3. **Scalability**: Capable of scaling with the application and user base.
4. **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with React and our existing tech stack.
5. **Community Support**: Active community and good documentation.
6. **Customization**: Allows for customization to fit specific project needs.

## Considered Options

1. **React Query**
2. **Apollo Client**
3. **Redux Toolkit (RTK Query)**
4. **SWR**
5. **Relay**

### Option 1: React Query

**Description**: React Query is a data-fetching library for React applications that simplifies data fetching, caching, synchronization, and more.

#### Pros
- **Ease of Use**: Simple and intuitive API.
- **Performance**: Optimized for performance with built-in caching and background refetching.
- **Features**: Provides powerful features like pagination, infinite scrolling, and optimistic updates.

#### Cons
- **Learning Curve**: Requires understanding of hooks and React concepts.
- **Customization**: Limited compared to more extensive state management libraries.

### Option 2: Apollo Client

**Description**: Apollo Client is a comprehensive state management library for JavaScript that enables you to manage both local and remote data with GraphQL.

#### Pros
- **Integration**: Excellent integration with GraphQL.
- **Features**: Rich feature set, including caching, pagination, and real-time updates.
- **Community Support**: Strong community and extensive documentation.

#### Cons
- **Complexity**: More complex setup and steeper learning curve.
- **Overhead**: May introduce unnecessary overhead if not using GraphQL.

### Option 3: Redux Toolkit (RTK Query)

**Description**: Redux Toolkit (RTK) Query is a powerful data-fetching and caching tool for Redux applications.

#### Pros
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing Redux state management.
- **Performance**: Optimized for performance with built-in caching and deduplication.
- **Features**: Provides tools for managing server state, including optimistic updates and automatic retries.

#### Cons
- **Complexity**: Requires understanding of Redux and RTK.
- **Boilerplate**: Can introduce additional boilerplate code compared to simpler libraries.

### Option 4: SWR

**Description**: SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate) is a React Hooks library for data fetching.

#### Pros
- **Ease of Use**: Simple and intuitive API with minimal setup.
- **Performance**: Optimized for performance with background data revalidation.
- **Integration**: Easily integrates with React and Next.js.

#### Cons
- **Features**: Limited features compared to more comprehensive libraries.
- **Customization**: Less customizable for complex state management needs.

### Option 5: Relay

**Description**: Relay is a JavaScript framework for building data-driven React applications with GraphQL.

#### Pros
- **Performance**: Highly optimized for performance with efficient data fetching and caching.
- **Integration**: Designed to work seamlessly with GraphQL and React.
- **Scalability**: Scales well with large applications and complex data requirements.

#### Cons
- **Complexity**: Steep learning curve and complex setup.
- **GraphQL Dependency**: Tightly coupled with GraphQL, not suitable for REST APIs.

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen Approach: **React Query with Apollo Client for GraphQL**

For our large-scale React.js project, we recommend using **React Query** for general data fetching and **Apollo Client** for GraphQL-based data management:

- **React Query**: Provides a simple and powerful API for managing server state, with built-in caching, background data fetching, and other performance optimizations. It integrates well with React and Next.js, making it a suitable choice for our project.
- **Apollo Client**: For projects using GraphQL, Apollo Client offers a comprehensive solution with excellent integration, caching, and real-time updates. It handles both local and remote data management efficiently.

This combination ensures a robust, scalable, and efficient solution for managing server state and API interactions in our project.
