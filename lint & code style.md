# ADR: Lint & Code Style for Large Scale React.js Project

## Context and Problem Statement

Maintaining a consistent code style and ensuring code quality through linting is crucial for large-scale React.js projects. With a team of developers working on a complex application, having a standardized approach to linting and code style helps in reducing bugs, improving readability, and maintaining code consistency across the project.

## Decision Drivers

1. **Consistency**: The linting and code style tools should enforce consistent coding practices across the entire codebase.
2. **Ease of Use**: The tools should be easy to set up and use, integrating smoothly into the development workflow.
3. **Customizability**: The tools should allow customization of rules and configurations to fit the projectâ€™s specific needs.
4. **Community and Ecosystem**: The tools should have strong community support and be actively maintained.
5. **Integration**: The tools should integrate well with development environments, CI/CD pipelines, and other tools used in the project.

## Considered Options

1. **ESLint**
2. **Prettier**
3. **Stylelint**
4. **Husky and lint-staged**

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen Tools: **ESLint, Prettier, and Husky with lint-staged**

#### Justification

- **ESLint**:
    - **Consistency**: ESLint is a powerful tool for enforcing coding standards and catching common errors. It provides a wide range of rules and plugins that can be customized to maintain consistency across the codebase.
    - **Ease of Use**: ESLint is widely used and well-documented, making it easy to integrate into various development environments and workflows.
    - **Customizability**: ESLint allows for extensive customization of rules and configurations, enabling teams to enforce their specific coding standards.
    - **Community and Ecosystem**: ESLint has strong community support and a rich ecosystem of plugins and integrations.

- **Prettier**:
    - **Consistency**: Prettier is an opinionated code formatter that enforces a consistent code style across the project. It works well in combination with ESLint to ensure both code style and quality.
    - **Ease of Use**: Prettier automatically formats code according to predefined rules, reducing the need for manual formatting and improving developer productivity.
    - **Customizability**: Prettier offers some configuration options for code formatting but is generally opinionated to enforce a consistent style.
    - **Community and Ecosystem**: Prettier has strong community support and integrates well with ESLint and other development tools.

- **Husky and lint-staged**:
    - **Consistency**: Husky and lint-staged automate linting and code formatting tasks as part of the Git commit process, ensuring that code quality checks are performed before changes are committed.
    - **Ease of Use**: These tools integrate with Git hooks, providing a seamless experience for running linting and formatting tasks before code is committed.
    - **Customizability**: Husky and lint-staged can be customized to run specific linting and formatting tasks, allowing for flexibility in the development workflow.
    - **Community and Ecosystem**: Both tools have strong community support and are widely used in modern development workflows.

#### Trade-offs

- **ESLint vs. Stylelint**:
    - **Stylelint**: Focuses on linting CSS and other stylesheet formats. While useful for managing style code, it is less relevant for JavaScript and TypeScript linting.
    - **ESLint**: Provides comprehensive linting for JavaScript and TypeScript, making it the primary choice for ensuring code quality in a React.js project.

- **Prettier vs. ESLint Formatting Rules**:
    - **Prettier**: Handles automatic code formatting consistently across the project, reducing the need for manual formatting. Works best when used
