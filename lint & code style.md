# ADR: Linting and Code Style for Large Scale React.js Project

## Context and Problem Statement

Maintaining consistent code style and quality across a large-scale React.js project is crucial for readability, maintainability, and reducing bugs. A robust linting and code style strategy ensures that all developers adhere to the same standards, leading to a more cohesive and efficient codebase.

## Decision Drivers

1. **Consistency**: Ensure a consistent code style across the entire codebase.
2. **Error Prevention**: Catch potential errors and bad practices early.
3. **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with development workflows and CI/CD pipelines.
4. **Community Support**: Strong community support and regular updates.
5. **Customization**: Ability to customize rules according to project-specific needs.

## Considered Options

1. **ESLint**
2. **Prettier**
3. **TSLint**
4. **StandardJS**
5. **Airbnb Style Guide**

### Option 1: ESLint

**Description**: ESLint is a highly configurable linting tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.

#### Pros
- **Highly Customizable**: Extensive configuration options and plugins.
- **Error Detection**: Excellent at catching a wide range of errors and code smells.
- **Integration**: Integrates well with most code editors and CI/CD pipelines.

#### Cons
- **Configuration Overhead**: Initial setup and configuration can be time-consuming.
- **Learning Curve**: Requires some learning to fully leverage its capabilities.

### Option 2: Prettier

**Description**: Prettier is an opinionated code formatter that enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules.

#### Pros
- **Consistency**: Ensures consistent code formatting across the codebase.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple to set up and use, with minimal configuration.
- **Integration**: Works well with ESLint and most code editors.

#### Cons
- **Opinionated**: Limited customization options compared to ESLint.
- **Not a Linter**: Focuses solely on code formatting, not linting.

### Option 3: TSLint

**Description**: TSLint is a linter for TypeScript that helps in enforcing coding guidelines and catching errors in TypeScript code.

#### Pros
- **TypeScript Support**: Specifically designed for TypeScript, catching type-specific issues.
- **Customizable**: Offers a range of configuration options and rules.

#### Cons
- **Deprecation**: Deprecated in favor of ESLint with TypeScript plugins.
- **Community Support**: Limited updates and community support moving forward.

### Option 4: StandardJS

**Description**: StandardJS is a JavaScript style guide, linter, and formatter combined into one tool, enforcing a specific style guide.

#### Pros
- **Simplicity**: No configuration needed; enforces a strict style guide out of the box.
- **Integration**: Works well with most code editors and CI/CD pipelines.

#### Cons
- **Lack of Flexibility**: Not customizable, which may not suit all projects.
- **Opinionated**: Enforces a specific style that may not align with project preferences.

### Option 5: Airbnb Style Guide

**Description**: The Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide is a widely used set of style rules for writing clean and consistent JavaScript code.

#### Pros
- **Industry Standard**: Widely adopted and respected in the JavaScript community.
- **Comprehensive**: Covers a wide range of best practices and style rules.

#### Cons
- **Complexity**: Can be overwhelming due to the number of rules.
- **Configuration**: Requires setup and integration with ESLint.

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen Approach: **Combination of ESLint and Prettier with Airbnb Style Guide**

For our large-scale React.js project, we recommend using a combination of **ESLint**, **Prettier**, and the **Airbnb Style Guide**:

- **ESLint**: For its extensive linting capabilities, customizability, and strong community support.
- **Prettier**: For consistent code formatting and ease of integration with ESLint.
- **Airbnb Style Guide**: As the base style guide to ensure adherence to widely accepted best practices and coding standards.

This combination provides a robust and flexible linting and code style strategy, ensuring code quality and consistency across the codebase.
