# ADR: Team Management for Large Scale React.js Project

## Context and Problem Statement

As our large-scale React.js project grows, effective team management becomes crucial for scaling development efforts. Forming small, focused teams based on features or components can enhance productivity and maintainability. Proper team management ensures that the project structure supports team dynamics and enables efficient collaboration.

## Decision Drivers

1. **Scalability**: Ability to scale the team structure with project growth.
2. **Productivity**: Enhances productivity by organizing teams around specific features or components.
3. **Collaboration**: Facilitates efficient communication and collaboration between teams.
4. **Maintainability**: Ensures that the project remains manageable and maintainable as it grows.
5. **Flexibility**: Adapts to changing project requirements and team dynamics.
6. **Ownership**: Encourages ownership and accountability within smaller teams.

## Considered Options

1. **Feature-Based Teams**
2. **Component-Based Teams**
3. **Cross-Functional Teams**
4. **Matrix Organization**
5. **Guilds or Chapters**

### Option 1: Feature-Based Teams

**Description**: Teams are organized around specific features or functionalities of the application. Each team is responsible for the complete lifecycle of their assigned feature, from development to deployment.

#### Pros
- **Focus**: Teams can focus on specific features, leading to deeper expertise and faster development.
- **Ownership**: Clear ownership of features, leading to better accountability and quality.
- **Efficiency**: Teams can work independently on their features, reducing dependencies.

#### Cons
- **Coordination**: Requires effective coordination between teams to manage dependencies between features.
- **Resource Utilization**: May lead to uneven distribution of resources if feature complexity varies.

### Option 2: Component-Based Teams

**Description**: Teams are organized around specific components or libraries used across the application. Each team is responsible for the development and maintenance of their assigned components.

#### Pros
- **Reusability**: Promotes the development of reusable components, leading to consistency and efficiency.
- **Expertise**: Teams can develop deep expertise in their specific components.
- **Consistency**: Ensures consistent implementation and maintenance of shared components.

#### Cons
- **Integration**: Requires effective integration of components into the overall application.
- **Coordination**: Needs careful management of component dependencies and updates.

### Option 3: Cross-Functional Teams

**Description**: Teams are organized to include members with various skills (e.g., frontend, backend, QA, UX) to cover all aspects of feature development within a single team.

#### Pros
- **Holistic Approach**: Provides a comprehensive approach to feature development, including design, development, and testing.
- **Collaboration**: Enhances collaboration and communication across different skill sets.
- **Agility**: Teams can adapt quickly to changes and address issues more effectively.

#### Cons
- **Specialization**: May dilute specialized expertise if team members need to cover multiple areas.
- **Coordination**: Requires effective coordination to ensure all aspects of feature development are addressed.

### Option 4: Matrix Organization

**Description**: Teams are organized into a matrix structure, where team members report to both functional managers (e.g., frontend, backend) and project managers (e.g., features or components).

#### Pros
- **Flexibility**: Allows for flexible allocation of resources based on project needs.
- **Specialization**: Maintains functional specialization while enabling cross-functional collaboration.
- **Resource Optimization**: Optimizes resource utilization across projects.

#### Cons
- **Complexity**: Can introduce complexity in reporting and decision-making.
- **Conflicts**: Potential for conflicts between functional and project management priorities.

### Option 5: Guilds or Chapters

**Description**: Guilds or chapters are cross-team groups focused on specific practices or technologies (e.g., frontend development, UX design). They provide support and share knowledge across different teams.

#### Pros
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Facilitates knowledge sharing and best practices across teams.
- **Support**: Provides support and guidance on specific practices or technologies.
- **Consistency**: Ensures consistency in practices and technologies across teams.

#### Cons
- **Coordination**: Requires coordination to ensure alignment between guilds and individual teams.
- **Time Management**: Team members may need to balance their time between guild activities and team responsibilities.

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen Approach: **Feature-Based Teams with Cross-Functional Elements**

For our large-scale React.js project, we recommend organizing teams around **features** while incorporating **cross-functional elements**:

- **Feature-Based Teams**: Allows teams to focus on specific features, enhancing ownership and expertise. Teams will be responsible for the full lifecycle of their features, from development to deployment.
- **Cross-Functional Elements**: Incorporates members with diverse skills (frontend, backend, QA, UX) within each feature-based team to ensure comprehensive development and quick adaptation to changes.

This approach balances focus and specialization with flexibility and collaboration, enabling effective scaling and maintainability of the project.
