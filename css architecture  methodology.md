# ADR: CSS Architecture / Methodology for Large Scale React.js Project

## Context and Problem Statement

Choosing an effective CSS architecture or methodology is essential for managing styles in a large-scale React.js project. With a project of this scale, the CSS solution should ensure maintainability, scalability, and consistency across various components and projects.

## Decision Drivers

1. **Scalability**: The methodology should support the growth of the project, making it easy to manage styles across a large number of components and pages.
2. **Maintainability**: The solution should facilitate easy updates and maintenance of styles, reducing the likelihood of conflicts and redundancy.
3. **Modularity**: It should promote a modular approach to styling, allowing styles to be encapsulated within components.
4. **Performance**: The solution should ensure efficient styling without negatively impacting performance.
5. **Consistency**: It should help maintain a consistent look and feel across the application.
6. **Integration**: The methodology should integrate well with React and other tools used in the project.

## Considered Options

1. **BEM (Block, Element, Modifier)**
2. **CSS Modules**
3. **Styled Components**
4. **Tailwind CSS**
5. **CSS-in-JS (e.g., Emotion)**
6. **Sass/SCSS**

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen Approach: **CSS Modules**

#### Justification

- **Scalability**: CSS Modules provide a scoped approach to styling, which helps avoid global style conflicts and makes it easier to scale styles as the project grows. Each componentâ€™s styles are encapsulated, which aids in managing large codebases.

- **Maintainability**: By scoping styles locally to components, CSS Modules reduce the risk of unintended side effects and make it easier to update and maintain styles. Styles are modular and can be updated independently.

- **Modularity**: CSS Modules promote a modular approach, allowing styles to be written and managed alongside the component logic. This enhances the reusability of styles and components.

- **Performance**: CSS Modules compile to unique class names, which ensures that styles are applied efficiently and without conflicts. This approach does not significantly impact performance and works well with various build tools.

- **Consistency**: CSS Modules help maintain consistency by scoping styles to specific components and preventing global overrides. This results in a more predictable and manageable styling system.

- **Integration**: CSS Modules integrate seamlessly with React and are supported by popular build tools like Webpack. They fit well within a React-based project and work effectively with other tools and methodologies.

#### Trade-offs

- **CSS Modules vs. BEM**:
    - **BEM**: Provides a clear and structured way to manage styles with a focus on naming conventions. However, BEM relies on global class names, which can lead to conflicts in large projects and does not inherently support encapsulation within components.
    - **CSS Modules**: Offers scoped styles, reducing conflicts and making it easier to manage styles locally within components.

- **CSS Modules vs. Styled Components**:
    - **Styled Components**: Uses a CSS-in-JS approach that allows for dynamic styling based on props and state. While powerful, it introduces additional complexity and may impact performance due to runtime styling.
    - **CSS Modules**: Provides a simpler approach to scoped styles with good performance and easier integration into the existing CSS workflow.

- **CSS Modules vs. Tailwind CSS**:
    - **Tailwind CSS**: Utilizes utility classes to style components, promoting a different approach to styling that can be very efficient but requires a shift in mindset and practices. Tailwind CSS is highly customizable but may not suit all projects, especially those preferring traditional CSS methods.
    - **CSS Modules**: Offers a more traditional CSS approach with scoped styles, fitting well with existing CSS workflows and avoiding the learning curve associated with utility-first methodologies.

- **CSS Modules vs. CSS-in-JS (e.g., Emotion)**:
    - **CSS-in-JS**: Allows for dynamic styling and theming, with styles defined in JavaScript files. This approach can be powerful but adds complexity and may have performance implications.
    - **CSS Modules**: Provides a simpler approach with precompiled CSS and scoped class names, making it easier to manage and maintain.

- **CSS Modules vs. Sass/SCSS**:
    - **Sass/SCSS**: Adds features like variables, nesting, and mixins, which enhance CSS capabilities. While powerful, Sass/SCSS does not inherently provide scoped styles and may lead to conflicts in large projects.
    - **CSS Modules**: Offers scoped styles with a focus on modularity, making it easier to avoid conflicts and manage styles within React components.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### CSS Modules

- **Pros**:
    - Scoped styles, reducing conflicts and side effects
    - Enhances maintainability and modularity
    - Integrates well with React and build tools
    - Simple to set up and use

- **Cons**:
    - May require adjustments in how styles are written compared to traditional CSS
    - Limited support for dynamic styling compared to CSS-in-JS

### BEM

- **Pros**:
    - Clear and structured naming conventions
    - Promotes consistency in styling
    - Easy to understand and implement

- **Cons**:
    - Relies on global class names, which can lead to conflicts
    - Less modular compared to scoped CSS approaches

### Styled Components

- **Pros**:
    - CSS-in-JS approach with dynamic styling based on props and state
    - Supports theming and scoped styles
    - Good integration with React

- **Cons**:
    - Adds complexity and may impact performance
    - Requires learning a new syntax and paradigm

### Tailwind CSS

- **Pros**:
    - Utility-first approach with customizable utility classes
    - Promotes rapid development and consistent design
    - Good performance and ease of use

- **Cons**:
    - Requires a shift in mindset and practices
    - May not fit all projects, especially those preferring traditional CSS

### CSS-in-JS (e.g., Emotion)

- **Pros**:
    - Dynamic styling and theming capabilities
    - Scoped styles with good integration into JavaScript

- **Cons**:
    - Adds complexity and may impact performance
    - Requires additional setup and learning
