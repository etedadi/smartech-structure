# ADR: Base Patterns

## Context
Our enterprise-level project serves approximately 300,000 users and includes advanced user panels similar to those found in Google Ads and Adjust.com. We have small teams of 1-3 developers per project, working in Agile and Scrum methodologies. The goal is to adopt base patterns that ensure maintainability, scalability, and a clear, consistent codebase.

## Decision
We will adopt a set of general and React-specific base patterns to guide development. These include:

1. **Component-Based Architecture**
2. **Container-Presenter Pattern**
3. **Higher-Order Components (HOCs) and Render Props**
4. **Custom Hooks**
5. **Atomic Design**
6. **Error Boundaries**

## Rationale

1. **Component-Based Architecture**:
   - **Description**: Build the UI using reusable, self-contained components.
   - **Benefits**:
     - Encourages code reuse, reducing duplication.
     - Simplifies testing and debugging by isolating components.
     - Facilitates team collaboration by allowing developers to work on different components simultaneously.
   - **Example**: Break down a user dashboard into components like `Header`, `Sidebar`, `UserStats`, and `ActivityFeed`.

2. **Container-Presenter Pattern**:
   - **Description**: Separate components into containers (logic and state management) and presenters (UI rendering).
   - **Benefits**:
     - Enhances separation of concerns, making components easier to understand and maintain.
     - Promotes reusability of presenter components across different containers.
   - **Example**: A `UserProfileContainer` handles data fetching and state, while a `UserProfile` presenter displays the user information.

3. **Higher-Order Components (HOCs) and Render Props**:
   - **Description**: Reuse component logic using HOCs or render props.
   - **Benefits**:
     - Enables logic reuse without duplicating code.
     - Keeps components focused on their primary responsibilities.
   - **Example**: An `withAuth` HOC that adds authentication logic to any component, or a `DataFetcher` component using render props to pass fetched data to its children.

4. **Custom Hooks**:
   - **Description**: Encapsulate and reuse stateful logic using React hooks.
   - **Benefits**:
     - Simplifies state management and side effects in functional components.
     - Promotes code reuse and organization.
   - **Example**: A `useFetch` hook that handles data fetching logic and can be used across various components.

5. **Atomic Design**:
   - **Description**: Build UI components based on the principles of atomic design: atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages.
   - **Benefits**:
     - Provides a structured approach to building and organizing UI components.
     - Enhances consistency and scalability in UI development.
   - **Example**: An `atom` like a button, a `molecule` like a form field with a label, an `organism` like a search bar, a `template` like a search page layout, and a `page` like a complete search results page.

6. **Error Boundaries**:
   - **Description**: Use error boundary components to catch JavaScript errors anywhere in the component tree.
   - **Benefits**:
     - Improves application stability by preventing crashes due to unhandled errors.
     - Provides a way to gracefully handle errors and display fallback UI.
   - **Example**: An `ErrorBoundary` component wrapping the main application to catch and handle errors.

## Consequences

- **Positive**:
  - **Consistency and Clarity**: Adopting these patterns ensures a consistent approach to component development, making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.
  - **Reusability**: Patterns like component-based architecture and custom hooks promote code reuse, reducing duplication and effort.
  - **Scalability**: Patterns such as atomic design and container-presenter facilitate scalable UI development, allowing the application to grow without becoming unmanageable.
  - **Robustness**: Error boundaries enhance application robustness by handling errors gracefully.

- **Negative**:
  - **Learning Curve**: Developers may need time to learn and become proficient with these patterns, which could slow initial development.
  - **Complexity**: Overusing patterns like HOCs and render props can lead to complexity and harder-to-read code if not used judiciously.

## Decision Outcome
By adopting these base patterns, we aim to create a scalable, maintainable, and consistent codebase for our enterprise-level project. These patterns will support our small development teams, allowing them to efficiently manage and extend the application as it grows.
